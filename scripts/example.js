From what it looks like, &quot;ConstraintViolationException&quot; is something that is going to be expected a lot.\nExceptions make the code uglier, harder to debug, and reduce JVM optimizations that greatly speed up program execution. \n\nSecond, you should only use checked exceptions (exceptions that don&#39;t extend from RuntimeException) if the caller can be reasonable expected to recover.  In your case, the caller doesn&#39;t do anything to recover except give the client an error message. \nBy throwing a checked exception, you force the caller to handle the exception in a catch clause or propagate it outwards.  (Both are these pitfalls are detailed in Joshua Bloch&#39;s excellent book, &quot;Effective Java&quot;.)\n\nThird, in your exception handling, you try to parse the error message.  This can be very problematic because third parties often change their error messages, because they\nare not a part of the API.  Once this happens, you&#39;re code is broken.  Another minor problem in your exception handling is that tie your JPA implementation to hibernate.  What if later you want to change to EclipseLink?\n\nThere is a way to address all these issues.\nGet rid of the exception handling in your DAO.\nAdd the following method to your DAO:\n\n\n\nThen, in your controller, have something like:\n\n\n\nYou will need some sort of exceptionHandler in the controller.  (If you&#39;re using Spring MVC, you can just add it as another method using the ExceptionHandler annotation.)\nThis would address things that are truly exceptions (things that are out of the ordinary for the everyday user experience, and things that the user can&#39;t fix.)\n",

It records something, but I&#39;m not quite sure what it is it&#39;s recording. \n\nIt appears that on emulator the audio samples are being read at about double the rate as on actual devices. In the app I have a visual progress widget (a horizontally moving recording head), which moves about twice as fast in emulator. \n\nHere is the recording loop:\n\n\n\nThe audio source is set to &quot;CAMCORDER&quot; and it records in stereo. The idea is, if the phone has multiple microphones, the app will process data from both and use whichever has better SNR. But I have the same problems if recording mono from . It reads audio data in a  loop, I am assuming that  is a blocking call and will not let me read same data twice.\n\nThe recorded data looks OK – the record buffer contains 16-bit PCM samples for two channels. The loop just seems to be running at twice the speed as on real devices. Which leads me to think that maybe the emulator is using a higher sampling rate than the specified 44100Hz. If I query the sample rate with  it returns the correct value. \n\nAlso there are some interesting audio related messages in logcat while recording:\n\n\n\nI&#39;m using up-to-date Android Studio and Android SDK, and I have tried emulator images running API levels 21-24. My dev environment is Ubuntu 16.04\n\nHas anybody experienced something similar? \nAm I doing something wrong in my recording loop? \n",

        "body": "You&#39;re almost right on with your CDI producer. Only thing is that you should use a producer method instead of a producer field.\n\nIf you&#39;re using Weld as CDI container (GlassFish 4.1 and WildFly 8.2.0), then your example of combining ,  and  on a producer field should throw this exception during deployment:\n\n\n  org.jboss.weld.exceptions.DefinitionException: WELD-001502:\n  Resource producer field [Resource Producer Field [EntityManager] with\n  qualifiers [@Any @Default] declared as [[BackedAnnotatedField]\n  @Produces @RequestScoped @PersistenceContext\n  com.somepackage.EntityManagerProducer.entityManager]] must be\n  @Dependent scoped\n\n\nTurns out that the container is not required to support any other scope than @Dependent when using a producer field to lookup Java EE resources.\n\nCDI 1.2, section 3.7. Resources:\n\n\n  The container is not required to support resources with scope other\n  than @Dependent. Portable applications should not define resources\n  with any scope other than @Dependent.\n\n\nThis quote was all about producer fields. Using a producer method to lookup a resource is totally legit:\n\n\n\nFirst, the container will instantiate the producer and a container-managed entity manager reference will be injected into the  field. Then the container will call your producer method and wrap what he returns in a request scoped CDI proxy. This CDI proxy is what your client code get when using . Because the producer class is @Dependent (default), the underlying container-managed entity manager reference will not be shared by any other CDI proxies produced. Every time another request want the entity manager, a new instance of the producer class will be instantiated and a new entity manager reference will be injected into the producer which in turn is wrapped in a new CDI proxy.\n\nTo be technically correct, the underlying and unnamed container who do the resource injection into the field  is allowed to reuse old entity managers (see footnote in JPA 2.1 specification, section &quot;7.9.1 Container Responsibilities&quot;, page 357). But so far, we honor the programming model required by JPA.\n\nIn the preceding example, it would not matter if you mark  @Dependent or @RequestScoped. Using @Dependent is semantically more correct. But if you put a wider scope than request scope on the producer class you risk exposing the underlying entity manager reference to many threads which we both know is not a good thing to do. The underlying entity manager implementation is probably a thread-local object, but portable applications cannot rely on implementation details.\n\nCDI does not know how to close whatever stuff it is that you put into the request bound context. More so than anything else, a container-managed entity manager must not be closed by application code.\n\nJPA 2.1, section &quot;7.9.1 Container Responsibilities&quot;:\n\n\n  The container must throw the IllegalStateException if the application\n  calls EntityManager.close on a container-managed entity manager.\n\n\nUnfortunately, many people do use a  method to close the container-managed entity manager. Who can blame them when the official Java EE 7 tutorial provided by Oracle as well as the CDI specification itself use a disposer to close a container-managed entity manager. This is simply wrong and the call to  will throw a  no matter where you put that call, in a disposer method or somewhere else. The Oracle example is the biggest sinner of the two by declaring the producer class to be a . As we learned, this risk exposing the underlying entity manager reference to many different threads.\n\nIt has been proven here that by using CDI producers and disposers wrongfully, 1) the not thread-safe entity manager may be leaked to many threads and 2) the disposer has no effect; leaving the entity manager open. What happened was the IllegalStateException which the container swallowed leaving no trace of it (a mysterious log entry is made which says there was an &quot;error destroying an instance&quot;).\n\nGenerally, using CDI to lookup container-managed entity managers is not a good idea. The application is most likely better off just using  and be happy with it. But there are always exceptions to the rule like in your example, and CDI can also be useful to abstract away the  when handling the life cycle of application-managed entity managers.\n\nTo get a complete picture on how to obtain a container-managed entity manager and how to use CDI to lookup entity managers, you might want to read this and this.\n",

E.g. the server socket approach fails if another application happens to already be listening to the port.\n\nJust download Microsoft Windows Sysinternals TCPView (or use netstat), start it, sort by &quot;State&quot;, look for the line block that says &quot;LISTENING&quot;, pick one whose remote address says your computer&#39;s name, put that port into your new-Socket()-solution. In my implementation of it, I can produce failure every time. And it&#39;s logical, because it&#39;s the very foundation of the approach. Or what am I not getting regarding how to implement this?\n\nPlease inform me if and how I am wrong about this!\n\nMy view - which I am asking you to disprove if possible - is that developers are being advised to use an approach in production code that will fail in at least 1 of about 60000 cases. And if this view happens to be correct, then it can absolutely not be that a solution presented that does not have this problem is downvoted and criticized for its amount of code.\n\nDisadvantages of the socket approach in comparison:\n\n\nFails if the wrong lottery ticket (port number) is chosen.\nFails in multi user environment: Only one user can run the application at the same time.

To tell the already running instance that another instance tried to start (but didn&#39;t) ... a file is created and immediately deleted, and the first instance uses the WatchService to detect this folder content change. I can&#39;t believe that apparently this is a new idea, given how fundamental the problem is.\n\nThis can easily be changed to just create and not delete the file, and then information can be put into it that the proper instance can evaluate, e.g. the command line arguments - and the proper instance can then perform the deletion.

Specifically, I found that trying to dismiss a dialog could result in an IllegalStateException. Again, an explanation for this can be found in another blog post by Alex Lockwood. Specifically, this section explains what is going on:\n\n\n  Avoid performing transactions inside asynchronous callback methods.\n  \n  This includes commonly used methods such as AsyncTask#onPostExecute()\n  and LoaderManager.LoaderCallbacks#onLoadFinished(). The problem with\n  performing transactions in these methods is that they have no\n  knowledge of the current state of the Activity lifecycle when they are\n  called. For example, consider the following sequence of events:\n  \n  \n  An activity executes an AsyncTask.\n  The user presses the &quot;Home&quot; key,\n  causing the activity&#39;s onSaveInstanceState() and onStop() methods to\n  be called.\n  The AsyncTask completes and onPostExecute() is called,\n  unaware that the Activity has since been stopped.\n  A FragmentTransaction is committed inside the onPostExecute() method,\n  causing an exception to be thrown.\n  \n\n\nHowever, it seems to me that this is part of a wider problem, it just happens that the fragment manager throws an exception to make you aware of it. In general, any change you make to the UI after  will be lost. So the advice\n\n\n  Avoid performing transactions inside asynchronous callback methods.\n\n\nActually should be:\n\n\n  Avoid performing UI updates inside asynchronous callback methods.\n\n\nQuestions:\n\n\nIf using this pattern, should you therefore cancel your task, preventing callbacks in  if not rotating?\n\n\nLike so:\n\n\n\n\nShould you even bother using retained fragments at all for retaining ongoing tasks? Will it be more effective to always mark something in your model about an ongoing request? Or do something like RoboSpice where you can re-connect to an ongoing task if it is pending. To get a similar behaviour to the retained fragment, you&#39;d have to cancel a task if you were stopping for reasons other than a config change.\nContinuing from the first question: Even during a config change, you should not be making any UI updates after  so should you actually do something like this:\n\n\nRough code:\n\n\n\nThe  would do something like the PauseHandler seen here\n",

IntelliJ flags Exceptions that do not subclass java.lang.RuntimeException because that is an actual compilation error. \n\nLet&#39;s look at the JavaDoc for Exception:\n\n\n  The class Exception and any subclasses that are not also subclasses of RuntimeException are checked exceptions. Checked exceptions need to be declared in a method or constructor&#39;s throws clause if they can be thrown by the execution of the method or constructor and propagate outside the method or constructor boundary.\n\n\n... And the JavaDoc for RuntimeException:\n\n\n  RuntimeException and its subclasses are unchecked exceptions. Unchecked exceptions do not need to be declared in a method or constructor&#39;s throws clause if they can be thrown by the execution of the method or constructor and propagate outside the method or constructor boundary.\n\n\nIn other words, you can throw a RuntimeException overtly in your code, and you don&#39;t necessarily have to declare it or catch it, and your compiler will be perfectly happy with that (although your API&#39;s users might not be so jolly). On the other hand, Exceptions that do not subclass RuntimeException are called &quot;checked&quot; exceptions, and must either be declared as thrown by your methods or caught and handled when they might occur, in accordance with the language&#39;s specifications.\n\n(P.S., if you didn&#39;t catch it yet, NullPointerException is a RuntimeException. Hence, it is unchecked.)\n",

        "body": "Here&#39;s an alternative solution building on the accepted answer.\n\nSummary\nIf you want to eliminate all production runtime cost from your service (even the relatively small one of picking up the XML artifacts which are then consumed by the #collect API), you can move the cost to the unit testing stage while still retaining 100% safety in prod of all entities being registered. See end of answer for code.\n\nMotivation &amp; Details\nThis has several benefits as outlined below, though whether they are worth it is up to your use case. To me personally, it isn&#39;t whether any of these are ever going to be a problem -- it&#39;s more that given the option to avoid doing anything unnecessary in production (and deleting code from production paths), I would always take it, as long as it doesn&#39;t entail extra complexity, weird design costs, etc. In this case there are none. This is a text-book approach of moving runtime registration guarantees from prod to testing.\n\nNote that GAE instances may get restarted arbitrarily many times. Other considerations include how sensitive your app is to service startup times, how large the generated Reflection XML artifacts are (a function of your jar dependencies and impl details of the Reflection 3rd party library), and how efficiently the library parses them. While you can mitigate performance risk with multi-threading, google still charges you for CPU time used.\n\nThe relative benefits of converting this to a unit test solution are:\n\n\nyou eliminate the cost of parsing XML resources and reconstructing them into Reflection metadata each time your service is restarted (may happen arbitrarily many times)\nyou eliminate the risk of changing your project JAR dependencies at some future times (dependencies tend to grown over time for non-trivial projects) and forgetting to re-assess new size of XML resources and their parsing; this may start adding more sizeable overhead to your service restart time gradually, which is hard to pinpoint but affects users (contributing to the classic death-by-a-thousand-cuts)\nyou eliminate a runtime prod dependency on a 3rd library which is always good (the dependency will remain for your unit testing modules). For instance, if a future version of the library suddenly regresses on XML parsing speeds, you will need to deal with that in prod. It&#39;s a risk that can be eliminated.\n\n\nWhether these considerations remain purely academic depends on your use case and risk/cost tolerance.\n\nCaveat: if for some reason your release rollout process does not mandate passing unit tests, this clearly isn&#39;t the right approach. But I don&#39;t think that would be the case for many people.\n\nCode\nI&#39;ve omitted the outer test class for readability (assume all code lives in a Test class)\n\n\n\nAnd below is an example failure when a class annotated with  has not been registered with .\n\n\n  java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: No class &#39;[xxx].UserImpl&#39; was\n  registered  at\n  com.googlecode.objectify.impl.Registrar.getMetadataSafe(Registrar.java:120)\n    at\n  com.googlecode.objectify.ObjectifyFactory.getMetadata(ObjectifyFactory.java:210)\n    at\n  [xxx].OfyRegistrationTest.verifyRegistrationState(OfyRegistrationTest.java:56)\n    at\n  [xxx].OfyRegistrationTest.testOfyRegistration(OfyRegistrationTest.java:37)\n\n",

        "body": "In response to S&#233;bastien Renauld&#39;s comments: here&#39;s an article on Dependency Injection (DI) and Inversion of Control (IoC) with some examples, and a few extra words on the Hollywood principle (quite important when working on a framework).\n\nSaying your classes won&#39;t ever need more than a single instance doesn&#39;t mean that statics are a must. Far from it, actually. If you browse this site, and read through PHP questions that deal with the singleton &quot;pattern&quot;, you&#39;ll soon find out why singletons are a bit of a no-no.\n\nI won&#39;t go into the details, but testing and singletons don&#39;t mix. Dependency injection is definitely worth a closer look. I&#39;ll leave it at that for now.\n\nTo answer your question:\nYour exaple () implies you have a static property in the  class somewhere. Now if you&#39;ve done this, as you say, to facilitate access to given data, imagine what a nightmare it would be to debug your code, if that value were to change somewhere... It&#39;s a static, so change it once, and it&#39;s changed everywhere. Finding out where it was changed might be harder than you anticipated. Even so, that&#39;s nothing compared to the issues someone who uses your code will have in the same situation.\nAnd yet, the real problems will only start when that person using your code wants to test whatever it is he/she made: If you want to have access to an instance in a given object, that has been instantiated in some class, there are plenty of ways to do so (especially in a framework):\n\n\n\nAs you can see, the  class has a method that passes the  instance to your controller, or whatever part of your framework you want to grant access to scope of the  class.\nNote that I&#39;ve declared the  property as a private property, so I&#39;m using a getter. I can, if I wanted to, pass a connection to that getter. There&#39;s a lot more you can do with that connection, of course, but I can&#39;t be bothered writing a full framework to show you everything you can do here :).\n\nBasically, all your controllers will extend the  class, which could be an abstract class that looks like this:\n\n\n\nSo in your code, you can easily do something along the lines of:\n\n\n\nIn both cases, you can get that single DB instance like so:\n\n\n\nYou can test your framework with easily by passing a different DB connection to the  method, if the  property hasn&#39;t been set in this case. With some extra work you can register multiple DB connections at the same time and access those at will, too:\n\n\n\nThis is, by no means, the full explanation, but I wanted to get this answer in quite quickly before you end up with a huge static (and thus useless) codebase.\n\nIn response to comments from OP:\n\nOn how I&#39;d tackle the  class. Honestly, I&#39;d pretty much do the same thing as I&#39;d do with the  property as shown above. But I&#39;d probably allow for more targeted control on what class gets access to what part of the config:\n\n\n\nThose last two methods aren&#39;t really required, you could just as well write something like:\n\n\n\nAgain, this snippet is all a bit messy and incomplete, but it does go to show you that you can &quot;expose&quot; certain properties of one class, by passing a reference to that class to another. Even if the properties are private, you can use getters to access them all the same. You can also use various register-methods to control what it is the registered object is allowed to see, as I&#39;ve done with the DB-wrapper in my snippet. A DB class shouldn&#39;t deal with viewscripts and namespaces, or autoloaders. That&#39;s why I&#39;m only registering the DB section of the config.\n\nBasically, a lot of your main components will end up sharing a number of methods. In other words, they&#39;ll end up implementing a given interface. For each main component (assuming the classic MVC pattern), you&#39;ll have one abstract base-class, and an inheritance chain of 1 or 2 levels of child classes:  &gt;  &gt; .\nAt the same time, all of these classes will probably expect another instance to be passed to them when constructed. Just look at the  of any ZendFW project:\n\n\n\nThat&#39;s all you can see, but inside the application, all other classes are being instantiated. That&#39;s why you can access neigh on everything from anywhere: all classes have been instantiated inside another class along these lines:\n\n\n\nBy passing  to the constructor of a controller class, that class can use various getters and setters to get to whatever it needs... Look at the examples above, it could use , or  and use that data if that&#39;s what it needs.\nThat&#39;s how most frameworks I&#39;ve tinkered or worked with function: The application is kicks into action and determines what needs to be done. That&#39;s the Hollywood-principle, or Inversion of Control: the Application is started, and the application determines what classes it needs when. In the link I provided I believe this is compared to a store creating its own customers: the store is built, and decides what it wants to sell. In order to sell it, it will create the clients it wants, and provide them with the means they need to purchase the goods...\n\nAnd, before I forget: Yes, all this can be done without a single static variable, let alone function, coming into play. I&#39;ve built my own framework, and I&#39;ve never felt there was no other way than to &quot;go static&quot;. I did use the Factory pattern at first, but ditched it pretty quickly. \nIMHO, a good framework is modular: you should be able to use bits of it (like Symfony&#39;s components), without issues. Using the Factory pattern makes you assume too much. You assume class X will be available, which isn&#39;t a given.\nRegistering those classes that are available makes for far more portable components. Consider this:\n\n\n\nAs opposed to:\n\n\n\nThough the latter version is slightly more work to write, it&#39;s quite clear which of the two is the better bet. The first version just assumes too much, and doesn&#39;t allow for safety-nets. It&#39;s also quite dictatorial: suppose I&#39;ve written a test, and I need the results to go to another DB. I therefore need to change the DB connection, for the entire application (user input, errors, stats... they&#39;re all likely to be stored in a DB).\nFor those two reasons alone, the second snippet is the better candidate: I can pass another DB connection, that overwrites the application default, or, if I don&#39;t want to do that, I can either use the default connection, or attempt to create the default connection. Store the connection I just made, or not... the choice is entirely mine. If nothing works, I just get a  thrown at me, but that&#39;s not the point.\n",

This process repeats until the top of the stack is a left\nparenthesis. When that occurs, both parentheses are discarded.\nIf the symbol been scanned has a higher precedence than the symbol on the top of the stack,\nthe symbol being scanned is pushed onto the stack.\nIf the symbol been scanned has a lower or the same precedence than the symbol at the top of\nthe stack, the symbol at the top of the stack is popped off to the output. The symbol been\nscanned will be compared with the new top element on the stack, and the process continues.\nWhen the input is empty, the stack is popped to the output until the stack is empty. Then the\nalgorithm terminates.\nIf the input is empty but the stack still has a left parenthesis, or a right parenthesis is scanned\nwhen the stack is empty, the parenthesis of the original expression were unbalanced.\n\n\nAnd here is my code and the results so far for this assignment using a char[] stack. I tried to implement the above bullet points in the &quot;ExprConverter&quot; class under the &quot;toPostfix&quot; method, but I&#39;m fairly certain I did not do it correctly and this is the root of the problem, as I am getting incorrect output. \n\nStack Class:\n\n\n\nConverter Class: \n\n\n\nDriver Class:\n\n\n\nDriver Class Results:\n\n\n\nSo if anyone could help figure out what I am doing wrong, I would really appreciate it!\n",

        "body": "Here&#39;s an alternative solution building on the accepted answer.\n\nSummary\nIf you want to eliminate all production runtime cost from your service (even the relatively small one of picking up the XML artifacts which are then consumed by the #collect API), you can move the cost to the unit testing stage while still retaining 100% safety in prod of all entities being registered. See end of answer for code.\n\nMotivation &amp; Details\nThis has several benefits as outlined below, though whether they are worth it is up to your use case. To me personally, it isn&#39;t whether any of these are ever going to be a problem -- it&#39;s more that given the option to avoid doing anything unnecessary in production (and deleting code from production paths), I would always take it, as long as it doesn&#39;t entail extra complexity, weird design costs, etc. In this case there are none. This is a text-book approach of moving runtime registration guarantees from prod to testing.\n\nNote that GAE instances may get restarted arbitrarily many times. Other considerations include how sensitive your app is to service startup times, how large the generated Reflection XML artifacts are (a function of your jar dependencies and impl details of the Reflection 3rd party library), and how efficiently the library parses them. While you can mitigate performance risk with multi-threading, google still charges you for CPU time used.\n\nThe relative benefits of converting this to a unit test solution are:\n\n\nyou eliminate the cost of parsing XML resources and reconstructing them into Reflection metadata each time your service is restarted (may happen arbitrarily many times)\nyou eliminate the risk of changing your project JAR dependencies at some future times (dependencies tend to grown over time for non-trivial projects) and forgetting to re-assess new size of XML resources and their parsing; this may start adding more sizeable overhead to your service restart time gradually, which is hard to pinpoint but affects users (contributing to the classic death-by-a-thousand-cuts)\nyou eliminate a runtime prod dependency on a 3rd library which is always good (the dependency will remain for your unit testing modules). For instance, if a future version of the library suddenly regresses on XML parsing speeds, you will need to deal with that in prod. It&#39;s a risk that can be eliminated.\n\n\nWhether these considerations remain purely academic depends on your use case and risk/cost tolerance.\n\nCaveat: if for some reason your release rollout process does not mandate passing unit tests, this clearly isn&#39;t the right approach. But I don&#39;t think that would be the case for many people.\n\nCode\nI&#39;ve omitted the outer test class for readability (assume all code lives in a Test class)\n\n\n\nAnd below is an example failure when a class annotated with  has not been registered with .\n\n\n  java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: No class &#39;[xxx].UserImpl&#39; was\n  registered  at\n  com.googlecode.objectify.impl.Registrar.getMetadataSafe(Registrar.java:120)\n    at\n  com.googlecode.objectify.ObjectifyFactory.getMetadata(ObjectifyFactory.java:210)\n    at\n  [xxx].OfyRegistrationTest.verifyRegistrationState(OfyRegistrationTest.java:56)\n    at\n  [xxx].OfyRegistrationTest.testOfyRegistration(OfyRegistrationTest.java:37)\n\n",

It would completely violate the idea of abstracting the stream from its physical representation.\n\nThe sequence of bulk data operations goes in a pipeline, see the following picture:\n\n\nThe stream is somehow similar to the Schr&#246;dinger&#39;s cat - it is not materialized until you call the terminal operation. The stream handling is completely abstract and detached from the original stream source.\n\n\n\nIf you want to work so low-level with your original data storage, don&#39;t feel ashamed simply avoiding the streams. They are just a tool, not anything sacred. By introducing streams, the Good Old Collections are still as good as they were, with added value of the internal iteration - the new Iterable.forEach() method.\n\n\n\nAdded to satisfy your curiosity :)\n\nA possible solution follows. I don&#39;t like it myself, and I have not been able to solve all the generics issues there, but it works with limitations. \n\nThe idea is creating a collector returning the same type as the input collection. However, not all the collections provide a nullary constructor (with no parameters), and without it the Class.newInstance() method does not work. There is also the problem of the awkwardness of checked exceptions within lambda expression.

        "body": "You&#39;re almost right on with your CDI producer. Only thing is that you should use a producer method instead of a producer field.\n\nIf you&#39;re using Weld as CDI container (GlassFish 4.1 and WildFly 8.2.0), then your example of combining ,  and  on a producer field should throw this exception during deployment:\n\n\n  org.jboss.weld.exceptions.DefinitionException: WELD-001502:\n  Resource producer field [Resource Producer Field [EntityManager] with\n  qualifiers [@Any @Default] declared as [[BackedAnnotatedField]\n  @Produces @RequestScoped @PersistenceContext\n  com.somepackage.EntityManagerProducer.entityManager]] must be\n  @Dependent scoped\n\n\nTurns out that the container is not required to support any other scope than @Dependent when using a producer field to lookup Java EE resources.\n\nCDI 1.2, section 3.7. Resources:\n\n\n  The container is not required to support resources with scope other\n  than @Dependent. Portable applications should not define resources\n  with any scope other than @Dependent.\n\n\nThis quote was all about producer fields. Using a producer method to lookup a resource is totally legit:\n\n\n\nFirst, the container will instantiate the producer and a container-managed entity manager reference will be injected into the  field. Then the container will call your producer method and wrap what he returns in a request scoped CDI proxy. This CDI proxy is what your client code get when using . Because the producer class is @Dependent (default), the underlying container-managed entity manager reference will not be shared by any other CDI proxies produced. Every time another request want the entity manager, a new instance of the producer class will be instantiated and a new entity manager reference will be injected into the producer which in turn is wrapped in a new CDI proxy.\n\nTo be technically correct, the underlying and unnamed container who do the resource injection into the field  is allowed to reuse old entity managers (see footnote in JPA 2.1 specification, section &quot;7.9.1 Container Responsibilities&quot;, page 357). But so far, we honor the programming model required by JPA.\n\nIn the preceding example, it would not matter if you mark  @Dependent or @RequestScoped. Using @Dependent is semantically more correct. But if you put a wider scope than request scope on the producer class you risk exposing the underlying entity manager reference to many threads which we both know is not a good thing to do. The underlying entity manager implementation is probably a thread-local object, but portable applications cannot rely on implementation details.\n\nCDI does not know how to close whatever stuff it is that you put into the request bound context. More so than anything else, a container-managed entity manager must not be closed by application code.\n\nJPA 2.1, section &quot;7.9.1 Container Responsibilities&quot;:\n\n\n  The container must throw the IllegalStateException if the application\n  calls EntityManager.close on a container-managed entity manager.\n\n\nUnfortunately, many people do use a  method to close the container-managed entity manager. Who can blame them when the official Java EE 7 tutorial provided by Oracle as well as the CDI specification itself use a disposer to close a container-managed entity manager. This is simply wrong and the call to  will throw a  no matter where you put that call, in a disposer method or somewhere else. The Oracle example is the biggest sinner of the two by declaring the producer class to be a . As we learned, this risk exposing the underlying entity manager reference to many different threads.\n\nIt has been proven here that by using CDI producers and disposers wrongfully, 1) the not thread-safe entity manager may be leaked to many threads and 2) the disposer has no effect; leaving the entity manager open. What happened was the IllegalStateException which the container swallowed leaving no trace of it (a mysterious log entry is made which says there was an &quot;error destroying an instance&quot;).\n\nGenerally, using CDI to lookup container-managed entity managers is not a good idea. The application is most likely better off just using  and be happy with it. But there are always exceptions to the rule like in your example, and CDI can also be useful to abstract away the  when handling the life cycle of application-managed entity managers.\n\nTo get a complete picture on how to obtain a container-managed entity manager and how to use CDI to lookup entity managers, you might want to read this and this.\n",

The same code was working fine on API 19 but is throwing this error on API 23. I read on a few SO posts that the error (1, -2147483648) may be because the app doesn&#39;t have proper permission to read the file, however, I could not solve the problem. I don&#39;t know where I am going wrong or if I need to add anything for API 23. Could this be related to runtime permission as mediaPlayer reads the file from external storage? If so, where should I request permission. The wav file was recorded properly as I transferred it and played it on my computer.\n\nUPDATE: I used another wav file to check if the mediaRecord class and the conditions were working properly, they were. I now realize the problem is only the files that the app is recording and saving as wav cannot be read (but can be played fine on computer). I cannot figure it out as I was recording the same way on API 19 without checking for runtime permissions.\n\nUPDATE 2: I had to call the  method on the stop button  and  to reset data source.\nI also copied one of the recorded files on my computer and renamed it from  to  and put it back. It played fine. But I can still read other types of files with the similar date and time name format. Not sure if the problem is only with the name.\n\nAny help regarding this issue will be appreciated!\n",

        "body": "I&#39;d say the competition is between JMockit and PowerMock, then Mockito.\n\nI&#39;d leave &quot;plain&quot; jMock and EasyMock because they use only proxy &amp; CGLIB and do not use Java 5 instrumentation like the newer frameworks.\n\njMock also didn&#39;t have a stable release for over 4 years. jMock 2.6.0 required 2 years to go from RC1 to RC2, and then another 2 years before it actually got released.\n\nRegarding Proxy &amp; CGLIB vs instrumentation:\n\n\n  (EasyMock and jMock) are based on java.lang.reflect.Proxy,\n  which requires an interface to be\n  implemented. Additionally, they\n  support the creation of mock objects\n  for classes through CGLIB subclass\n  generation. Because of that, said\n  classes cannot be final and only\n  overridable instance methods can be\n  mocked. Most importantly, however,\n  when using these tools the\n  dependencies of code under test (that\n  is, the objects of other classes on\n  which a given class under test\n  depends) must be controlled by the\n  tests, so that mock instances can be\n  passed to the clients of those\n  dependencies. Therefore, dependencies\n  can&#39;t simply be instantiated with the\n  new operator in a client class for\n  which we want to write unit tests.\n  \n  Ultimately, the technical limitations\n  of conventional mocking tools impose\n  the following design restrictions on\n  production code:\n  \n  \n  Each class which may need to be mocked in a test must either implement\n  a separate interface or not be final.\n  The dependencies of each class to be tested must either be obtained\n  through configurable instance creation\n  methods (factories or a Service\n  Locator), or be exposed for dependency\n  injection. Otherwise, unit tests won&#39;t\n  be able to pass mock implementations\n  of dependencies to the unit under\n  test.\n  Since only instance methods can be mocked, classes to be unit tested\n  cannot call any static methods on\n  their dependencies, nor instantiate\n  them using any of the constructors.\n  \n\n\nThe above is copied from http://jmockit.org/about.html . Further, it compares between itself (JMockit), PowerMock, and Mockito in several ways:\n\n\n  There are now other mocking tools for\n  Java which also overcome the\n  limitations of the conventional ones,\n  between them PowerMock, jEasyTest, and\n  MockInject. The one that comes closest\n  to the feature set of JMockit is\n  PowerMock, so I will briefly evaluate\n  it here (besides, the other two are\n  more limited and don&#39;t seem to be\n  actively developed anymore).\n  \n  JMockit vs PowerMock\n  \n  \n  First of all, PowerMock does not provide a complete API for mocking,\n  but instead works as an extension to\n  another tool, which currently can be\n  EasyMock or Mockito. This is obviously\n  an advantage for existing users of\n  those tools.\n  JMockit, on the other hand, provides entirely new APIs, although\n  its main API (Expectations) is similar\n  to both EasyMock and jMock. While this\n  creates a longer learning curve, it\n  also allows JMockit to provide a\n  simpler, more consistent, and easier\n  to use API.\n  Compared to the JMockit Expectations API, the PowerMock API is\n  more &quot;low-level&quot;, forcing users to\n  figure out and specify which classes\n  need to be prepared for testing (with\n  the @PrepareForTest({ClassA.class,\n  ...}) annotation) and requiring\n  specific API calls to deal with\n  various kinds of language constructs\n  that may be present in the production\n  code: static methods\n  (mockStatic(ClassA.class)),\n  constructors\n  (suppress(constructor(ClassXyz.class))),\n  constructor invocations\n  (expectNew(AClass.class)), partial\n  mocks (createPartialMock(ClassX.class,\n  &quot;methodToMock&quot;)), etc.\n  With JMockit Expectations, all kinds of methods and constructors are\n  mocked in a purely declarative way,\n  with partial mocking specified through\n  regular expressions in the @Mocked\n  annotation or by simply &quot;un-mocking&quot;\n  the members with no recorded\n  expectations; that is, the developer\n  simply declares some shared &quot;mock\n  fields&quot; for the test class, or some\n  &quot;local mock fields&quot; and/or &quot;mock\n  parameters&quot; for individual test\n  methods (and in this last case the\n  @Mocked annotation often won&#39;t be\n  needed).\n  Some capabilities available in JMockit, such as support for mocking\n  equals and hashCode, overridden\n  methods, and others, are currently not\n  supported in PowerMock. Also, there is\n  no equivalent to JMockit&#39;s ability to\n  capture instances and mock\n  implementations of specified base\n  types as the test executes, without\n  the test code itself having any\n  knowledge of the actual implementation\n  classes.\n  PowerMock uses custom class loaders (usually one per test class)\n  in order to generate modified versions\n  of the mocked classes. Such heavy use\n  of custom class loaders can lead to\n  conflicts with third-party libraries,\n  hence the need to sometimes use the\n  @PowerMockIgnore(&quot;package.to.be.ignored&quot;)\n  annotation on test classes.\n  The mechanism used by JMockit (runtime instrumentation through a\n  &quot;Java agent&quot;) is simpler and safer,\n  although it does require passing a\n  &quot;-javaagent&quot; parameter to the JVM when\n  developing on JDK 1.5; on JDK 1.6+\n  (which can always be used for\n  development, even if deploying on an\n  older version) there is no such\n  requirement, since JMockit can\n  transparently load the Java agent on\n  demand by using the Attach API.\n  \n  \n  Another recent mocking tool is\n  Mockito. Although it does not attempt\n  to overcome the limitations of older\n  tools (jMock, EasyMock), it does\n  introduce a new style of behavior\n  testing with mocks. JMockit also\n  supports this alternative style,\n  through the Verifications API.\n  \n  JMockit vs Mockito\n  \n  \n  Mockito relies on explicit calls to its API in order to separate code\n  between the record (when(...)) and\n  verify (verify(...)) phases. This\n  means that any invocation to a mock\n  object in test code will also require\n  a call to the mocking API.\n  Additionally, this will often lead to\n  repetitive when(...) and\n  verify(mock)... calls.\n  With JMockit, no similar calls exist. Sure, we have the new\n  NonStrictExpectations() and new\n  Verifications() constructor calls, but\n  they occur only once per test\n  (typically), and are completely\n  separate from the invocations to\n  mocked methods and constructors.\n  The Mockito API contains several inconsistencies in the syntax used for\n  invocations to mocked methods. In the\n  record phase, we have calls like\n  when(mock.mockedMethod(args))... while\n  in the verify phase this same call\n  will be written as\n  verify(mock).mockedMethod(args).\n  Notice that in the first case the\n  invocation to mockedMethod is made\n  directly on the mock object, while in\n  the second case it is made on the\n  object returned by verify(mock).\n  JMockit has no such inconsistencies because invocations to\n  mocked methods are always made\n  directly on the mocked instances\n  themselves. (With one exception only:\n  to match invocations on the same\n  mocked instance, an onInstance(mock)\n  call is used, resulting in code like\n  onInstance(mock).mockedMethod(args);\n  most tests won&#39;t need to use this,\n  though.)\n  Just like other mocking tools which rely on method\n  chaining/wrapping, Mockito also runs\n  into inconsistent syntax when stubbing\n  void methods. For example, you write\n  when(mockedList.get(1)).thenThrow(new\n  RuntimeException()); for a non-void\n  method, and doThrow(new\n  RuntimeException()).when(mockedList).clear();\n  for a void one. With JMockit, it&#39;s\n  always the same syntax:\n  mockedList.clear(); result = new\n  RuntimeException();.\n  Yet another inconsistency occurs in the use of Mockito spies: &quot;mocks&quot;\n  that allow the real methods to be\n  executed on the spied instance. For\n  example, if spy refers to an empty\n  List, then instead of writing\n  when(spy.get(0)).thenReturn(&quot;foo&quot;) you\n  will need to write\n  doReturn(&quot;foo&quot;).when(spy).get(0). With\n  JMockit, the dynamic mocking feature\n  provides similar functionality to\n  spies, but without this issue since\n  real methods only get executed during\n  the replay phase.\n  In EasyMock and jMock, the first mocking APIs for Java, the focus was\n  entirely on the recording of expected\n  invocations of mocked methods, for\n  mock objects that (by default) do not\n  allow unexpected invocations. Those\n  APIs also provide the recording of\n  allowed invocations for mock objects\n  that do allow unexpected invocations,\n  but this was treated as a second-class\n  feature. Additionally, with these\n  tools there is no way to explicitly\n  verify invocations to mocks after the\n  code under test is exercised. All such\n  verifications are performed implicitly\n  and automatically.\n  In Mockito (and also in Unitils Mock), the opposite viewpoint is\n  taken. All invocations to mock objects\n  that may happen during the test,\n  whether recorded or not, are allowed,\n  never expected. Verification is\n  performed explicitly after the code\n  under test is exercised, never\n  automatically.\n  Both approaches are too extreme, and consequently less than optimal.\n  JMockit Expectations &amp; Verifications\n  is the only API that allows the\n  developer to seamlessly choose the\n  best combination of strict (expected\n  by default) and non-strict (allowed by\n  default) mock invocations for each\n  test.\n  To be more clear, the Mockito API has the following shortcoming. If you\n  need to verify that an invocation to a\n  non-void mocked method happened during\n  the test, but the test requires a\n  return value from that method that is\n  different from the default for the\n  return type, then the Mockito test\n  will have duplicate code: a\n  when(mock.someMethod()).thenReturn(xyz)\n  call in the record phase, and a\n  verify(mock).someMethod() in the\n  verify phase. With JMockit, a strict\n  expectation can always be recorded,\n  which won&#39;t have to be explicitly\n  verified. Alternatively, an invocation\n  count constraint (times = 1) can be\n  specified for any recorded non-strict\n  expectation (with Mockito such\n  constraints can only be specified in a\n  verify(mock, constraint) call).\n  Mockito has poor syntax for verifications in order, and for full\n  verifications (that is, checking that\n  all invocations to mock objects are\n  explicitly verified). In the first\n  case, an extra object needs to be\n  created, and calls to verify made on\n  it: InOrder inOrder = inOrder(mock1,\n  mock2, ...). In the second case, calls\n  like verifyNoMoreInteractions(mock) or\n  verifyZeroInteractions(mock1, mock2)\n  need to be made.\n  With JMockit, you simply write new VerificationsInOrder() or new\n  FullVerifications() instead of new\n  Verifications() (or new\n  FullVerificationsInOrder() to combine\n  both requirements). No need to specify\n  which mock objects are involved. No\n  extra mocking API calls. And as a\n  bonus, by calling\n  unverifiedInvocations() inside an\n  ordered verification block, you can\n  perform order-related verifications\n  that are simply impossible in Mockito.\n  \n  \n  Finally, the JMockit Testing Toolkit\n  has a wider scope and more ambitious\n  goals than other mocking toolkits, in\n  order to provide a complete and\n  sophisticated developer testing\n  solution. A good API for mocking, even\n  without artificial limitations, is not\n  enough for productive creation of\n  tests. An IDE-agnostic, easy to use,\n  and well integrated Code Coverage tool\n  is also essential, and that&#39;s what\n  JMockit Coverage aims to provide.\n  Another piece of the developer testing\n  toolset which will become more useful\n  as the test suite grows in size is the\n  ability to incrementally rerun tests\n  after a localized change to production\n  code; this is also included in the\n  Coverage tool.\n\n\n(granted, the source may be biased, but well...)\n\nI&#39;d say go with JMockit. It&#39;s the easiest to use, flexible, and works for pretty much all cases even difficult ones and scenarios when you can&#39;t control the class to be tested (or you can&#39;t break it due to compatibility reasons etc.).\n\nMy experiences with JMockit have been very positive.\n",

        "body": "Problem description\n\nTomcat is logging a SEVERE message including a stacktrace when my HttpServlet is throwing a ServletException, although it is properly re-directed to another HttpServlet in the web.xml. \n\nTomcat logs the following message with stacktrace:\n\n\n\nWhat did I do?\n\nFirst, MyHttpServlet throws a ServletException wrapping a CustomException (subclass of Exception) in it&#39;s doGet() method:\n\n\n\nThen, the thrown CustomException is re-directed to MyServletExceptionHandler (mapped to location &#39;/MyServletExceptionHandler&#39;. This re-direction is defined in the following manner in the web.xml:\n\n\n\nFinally, MyServletExceptionHandler receives the thrown exception and prints it:\n\n\n\nThis results in the expected &#39;MyServletExceptionHandler caught Throwable: CustomException&#39; print so this does work, but somehow Tomcat also logs the SEVERE message mentioned above, including that stacktrace. This messes up my logging.\n\nWhy do I want it this way?\n\nAccording to Java Beat&#39;s OCEJWCD 6 Mock Exam – 4 the above mentioned method is the proper way to deal with Exception handling in Servlets. Question 29 states (spoiler alert: bold are correct answers):\n\n\n  Which of the following is a sensible way of sending an error page to the client in case of a business exception that extends from java.lang.Exception?\n  \n  \n  Catch the exception and use RequestDispatcher to forward the request to the error page\n  Don’t catch the exception and define the ‘exception to error-page’ mapping in web.xml\n  Catch the exception, wrap it into ServletException and define the ‘business exception to error-page’ mapping in web.xml\n  Catch the exception, wrap it into ServletException, and define the ‘ServletException to error-page’ mapping in web.xml\n  Don’t do anything, the servlet container will automatically send a default error page\n  \n\n\nThe third answer (which is marked as correct) clearly states that my way of re-directing the exceptions is a sensible solution. \n\nFurther discussion material\n\nI found the following quote on this page (from 10-2-2012 by Tom Holloway at CodeRanch.com)\n\n\n  Actually, a ServletException has nowhere to go uphill in a webapp, and therefore having it appear on the master console isn&#39;t really that unreasonable, because it indicates that the application isn&#39;t handling the problem itself. \n  \n  In fact, the Javadocs say this about the ServletException constructor: \n  \n  \n    &quot;Constructs a new servlet exception with the specified message. The message can be written to the server log and/or displayed for the user.&quot;\n  \n  \n  Note that it explicitly says server log. \n  \n  The server can get involved in a number of ways here. First, you should be able to define a general exception handler in web.xml to permit the app to deal with the exception, where that handler can not only log to the application log, but can determine what, if any, recovery action should be taken (something that the more generic server code cannot do). Secondly, you can define a custom error page, in which case Tomcat will catch the ServletException and dispatch that page. Note, however that the operative word is page. Like login screens, these pages are invoked directly from Tomcat, and therefore cannot be routed through servlets. In other words, use HTML or JSP, not Struts or JSF. \n  \n  Bottom line, though, is that throwing ServletExceptions is a sign of bad application design. It means that someone was too lazy or too rushed to properly deal with a problem. Compared to that, the location where the error is logged is of secondary importance.\n\n\nThis statement makes me question the Java Beat&#39;s OCEJWCD Mock Exam (mentioned above) and my own solution as good practice. Do you think business exceptions should be handled by another Servlet? And if so, do you think that the Servlet Container (Tomcat) should log the stacktrace of these Exceptions or not? If not, what would then be the best practice?\n\nFinal remarks\n\n\nThrowing RuntimeExceptions instead of ServletExceptions results in the same SEVERE log.\nA working example of the problem is provided via this Bitbucket repository.\n\n",

This class is the general class of exceptions produced by failed or interrupted I/O operations.\n\nErrors\n\nThese are special kinds of exceptions. They SHOULD NOT BE CAUGHT for when they occur means that something really really bad just happened. \n\nAll of them inherit from \n\n\n\nFor example:\n\n\n\nThrown when the Java Virtual Machine cannot allocate an object because it is out of memory, and no more memory could be made available by the garbage collector.\n\nor \n\n\n\nThrown when a stack overflow occurs because an application recurses too deeply.\n\nRuntimeExceptions\n\nUsed to identify programmer failures, rather than resource failures. \n\nA Runtime exception could &quot;normally&quot; be avoided while coding. If you have one most likely you&#39;re doing something wrong. \n\nSometimes runtime exceptions are caught, but, unless you know exactly what you&#39;re doing and why, catching them is a bad practice ( again, unless that&#39;s exactly what you need )\n\nThey inherit from \n\n\n\nFor example\n\n\n\nThrown to indicate that an array has been accessed with an illegal index.

Instead, the time zone of the input string, if any, will be used during parsing, and the time zone stored in  instance must be used during formatting.\n\nThe  will only give confusing results with  as it will act as fallback during parsing (it&#39;s only used when time zone is absent in input string or format pattern), and it will act as override during formatting (the time zone stored in  is entirely ignored). This is the root cause of your observable problem. Just omitting  while creating the formatter should fix it.\n\nDo note that when you have specified a converter, and don&#39;t have , then you don&#39;t need to specify . Even when you do, you&#39;d rather like to use  instead of hardcoding it.\nYou need to carry the time zone (offset) along over all layers, including the database. If your database, however, has a &quot;date time without time zone&quot; column type, then the time zone information gets lost during persist and you will run into trouble when serving back from database.\n\nIt&#39;s unclear which DB you&#39;re using, but keep in mind that some DBs doesn&#39;t support a  column type as known from Oracle and PostgreSQL DBs. For example, MySQL does not support it. You&#39;d need a second column.\n\n\nIf those changes are not acceptable, then you need to step back to  and rely on fixed/predefined time zone throughout all layers, including the database. Usually UTC is used for this.\n\n\n\nDealing with  in JSF and JPA\n\nWhen using  with an appropriate  DB column type, use the below JSF converter to convert between  in the UI and  in the model. This converter will lookup the  and  attributes from the parent component. If the parent component doesn&#39;t natively support a  or  attribute, simply add them as . If the  attribute is absent, the (default)  will be used instead.

        "body": "I had this same question, and was disappointed that there was no onErrorFlatMap for Scala Rx. So I took a stab\nat implementing this functionality myself.\n\nMy solution is shown below (see A SOLUTION). The key method is this one:\n\n\n\nDetails of &#39;recover&#39; method\n\nThe first argument to &#39;recover&#39; is the observable that you want to continue squeezing for events even after \nit throws an Exception.  I tried all manner of other approaches, but this was the only one that worked for\nme.  I initially had expected Scala Rx&#39;s onErrorReturn to map any error into the value dictated by my recovery\nfunction, and then keep going, but I was missing the whole point of the &#39;Observable contract&#39;, which is that \nan Observable needs to stop sending any further events after onCompleted, or OnError.  Any Observable that \ncontinues spewing events after an  error will be labeled &#39;pathological&#39; (and duly shunned by polite society),\nas discussed here: https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/wiki/Phantom-Operators#onerrorflatmap\n\nThe payload of successful onNext calls are wrapped in a Success(), whereas any exception will be handled \nby onErrorResumeNext, which will create concatenated Observable stream from (1) an Observable wrapping\nthe error, and (2) an instance of the target wrapped within a recursive call to recover.  I initially \nworried about infinite recursion.. But it all worked out nicely.\n\nLimitations\n\nI should mention that in the case of the original poster&#39;s question -- which uses Observable.interval, this\nwould not work well, since recover(target) would be the original Observable.interval, which would start\nemitting from the very beginning, so you would never make progress.  For something like interval, you would\nhave to write your own timer based interval that could be restarted. The exception value would hopefully \ngive you enough information to tell you the value you need to restart from.\n\n\n\nHere is partial output of a run of the above code:\n\n\n\nI didn&#39;t want this answer to go on forever, so I skipped over some details on alternative approaches I took to solving this problem, which you can read about here if you are interested.\n",

        "body": "I think I read the same Bruce Eckel interview that you did - and it&#39;s always bugged me. In fact, the argument was made by the interviewee (if this is indeed the post you&#39;re talking about) Anders Hejlsberg, the MS genius behind .Net and C#.\n\nhttp://www.artima.com/intv/handcuffs.html\n\nFan though I am of Hejlsberg and his work, this argument has always struck me as bogus. It basically boils down to: \n\n&quot;Checked exceptions are bad because programmers just abuse them by always catching them and dismissing them which leads to problems being hidden and ignored that would otherwise be presented to the user&quot;. \n\nBy &quot;otherwise presented to the user&quot; I mean if you use a runtime exception the lazy programmer will just ignore it (versus catching it with an empty catch block) and the user will see it.\n\nThe summary of the summary of the argument is that &quot;Programmers wont use them properly and not using them properly is worse than not having them&quot;.\n\nThere is some truth to this argument and in fact I suspect Goslings motivation for not putting operator overrides in Java comes from a similar argument - they confuse the programmer because they are often abused.\n\nBut in the end I find it a bogus argument of Hejlsbergs and possibly a post-hoc one created to explain the lack rather than a well thought out decision.\n\nI would argue that while the over-use of checked exceptions is a bad thing and tends to lead to sloppy handling by users, but the proper use of them allows the API programmer to give great benefit to the API client programmer.\n\nNow the API programmer has to be careful not to throw checked exceptions all over the place, or they will simply annoy the client programmer. The very lazy client programmer will resort to catch (Exception) {} as Hejlsberg warns and all benefit will be lost and hell will ensue.\nBut in some circumstances there&#39;s just no substitute for a good checked exception. \n\nFor me the classic example is the file-open API. Every programming language in the history of languages (on file systems at least) has an API somewhere that lets you open a file. And every client programmer using this API knows that they have to deal with the case that the file they are trying to open doesn&#39;t exist. \nLet me rephrase that: Every client programmer using this API should know that they have to deal with this case. \nAnd there&#39;s the rub: can the API progammer help them know they should deal with it through commenting alone or can they indeed insist the client deal with it.\n\nIn C the idiom goes something like\n\n\n\nwhere fopen indicates failure by returning 0 and C (foolishly) lets you treat 0 as a boolean and... Basically you learn this idiom and you&#39;re okay. But what if you&#39;re a noob and you didn&#39;t learn the idiom. Then of course you start out with\n\n\n\nand learn the hard way.\n\nNote that we&#39;re only talking about strongly typed languages here: There&#39;s a clear idea of what an API is in a strongly typed language: It&#39;s a smorgasbord of functionality (methods) for you to use with a clearly defined protocol for each one.\n\nThat clearly defined protocol is typically defined by a method signature. \nHere fopen requires that you pass it a string (or a char* in the case of C). If you give it something else you get a compile-time error. You didn&#39;t follow the protocol - you&#39;re not using the API properly.\n\nIn some (obscure) languages the return type is part of the protocol too. If you try to call the equivalent of fopen() in some languages without assigning it to a variable you&#39;ll also get a compile time error (you can only do that with void functions).\n\nThe point I&#39;m trying to make is that: In a statically typed language the API programmer encourages the client to use the API properly by preventing their client code from compiling if it makes any obvious mistakes.\n\n(In a dynamically typed language, like Ruby, you can pass anything, say a float, as the file name - and it will compile. Why hassle the user with checked exceptions if you&#39;re not even going to control the method arguments. The arguments made here apply to statically-typed langauges only)\n\nSo, what about checked exceptions?\n\nWell here&#39;s one of the Java APIs you can use for opening a file.\n\n\n\nSee that catch? Here&#39;s the signature for that API method:\n\n\n\nNote that FileNotFoundException is a checked exception.\n\nThe API programmer is saying this to you:\n  &quot;You may use this constructor to create a new FileInputStream but you \n\na) must pass in the file name as a\n    String\nb) must accept the\n    possibility that the file might not\n    be found at runtime&quot;\n\nAnd that&#39;s the whole point as far as I&#39;m concerned.\n\nThe key is basically what the question states as &quot;Things that are out of the programmers control&quot; My first thought was that he/she means things that are out of the API programmers control. But in fact, checked exceptions when used properly should really be for things that are out of both the client programmer&#39;s and the API programmer&#39;s control. I think this is the key to not abusing checked exceptions.\n\nI think the file-open illustrates the point nicely. The API programmer knows you might give them a file name that turns out to be nonexistent at the time the API is called, and that they won&#39;t be able to return you what you wanted, but will have to throw an exception. They also know that this will happen pretty regularly and that the client programmer might expect the file name to be correct at the time they wrote the call, but it might be wrong at runtime for reasons beyond their control too.\n\nSo the API makes it explicit: There will be cases where this file doesn&#39;t exist at the time you call me and you had damn well better deal with it.\n\nThis would be clearer with a counter-case. Imagine I&#39;m writing a table API. I have  table model somewhere with an API with this method:\n\n\n\nNow as an API programmer I know there will be cases where some client passes in a negative value for the row or a row value outside of the table. So I might be tempted to throw a checked exception and force the client to deal with it:\n\n\n\n(I wouldn&#39;t really call it &quot;Checked&quot; of course).\n\nThis is bad use of checked exceptions. The client code is going to be full of calls to fetch row data, every one of which is going to have to use a try/catch, and for what? Are they going to report to the user that the wrong row was sought? Probably not - because whatever the UI surrounding my table view is, it shouldn&#39;t let the user get into a state where an illegal row is being requested. So it&#39;s a bug on the part of the client programmer. \n\nThe API programmer can still predict that the client will code such bugs and should handle it with a runtime exception like an IllegalArgumentException. \n\nWith a checked exception in getRowData, this is clearly a case that&#39;s going to lead to Hejlsbergs lazy programmer simply adding empty catches. When that happens, the illegal row values will not be obvious even to the tester or the client developer debugging, rather they&#39;ll lead to knock-on errors that are hard to pinpoint the source of. Arianne rockets will blow up after launch. \n\nOkay, so here&#39;s the problem: I&#39;m saying that the checked exception FileNotFoundException is not just a good thing but an essential tool in the API programmers toolbox for defining the API in the most useful way for the client programmer. But the CheckedInvalidRowNumberException is a big inconvenience, leading to bad programming and should be avoided. But how to tell the difference. \n\nI guess it&#39;s not an exact science and I guess that underlies and perhaps justifies to a certain extent Hejlsbergs argument. But I&#39;m not happy throwing the baby out with the bathwater here, so allow me to extract some rules here to distinguish good checked exceptions from bad:\n\n\nOut of clients control or Closed vs Open: \n\nChecked exceptions should only be used where the error case is out of control of both the API and the client programmer.\nThis has to do with how open or closed the system is. In a constrained UI where the client programmer has control, say, over all of the buttons, keyboard commands etc that add and delete rows from the table view, (a closed system) it is a client programming bug if it attempts to fetch data from a nonexistent row. In a file based operating system where any number of users/applications can add and delete files (an open system) it is conceivable that the file the client is requesting has been deleted without their knowledge so they should be expected to deal with it.  \nUbiquity:\n\nChecked exceptions should not be used on an API call that is made frequently by the client.\nBy frequently I mean from a lot of places in the client code - not frequently in time. So a client code doesn&#39;t tend to try to open the same file a lot, but my table view gets RowData all over the place from different methods. In particular I&#39;m going to be writing a lot of code like\n\nif (model.getRowData().getCell(0).isEmpty())\n\nand it will be painful to have to wrap in try/catch every time.\nInforming the User:\n\nChecked exceptions should be used in cases where you can imagine a useful error message being presented to the end user. \nThis is the &quot;and what will you when it happens?&quot; question I raise above. It also relates to item 1. Since you can predict that something outside of your client-API system might cause the file to not be there, you can reasonably tell the user about it:\n\n&quot;Error: could not find the file &#39;goodluckfindingthisfile&#39;&quot;\n\nSince your illegal row number was caused by an internal bug and through no fault of the user, there&#39;s really no useful information you can give them. If your app doesn&#39;t let runtime exceptions fall through to the console it will probably end up giving them some ugly message like:\n\n&quot;Internal error occured: IllegalArgumentException in ....&quot;\n\nIn short, if you don&#39;t think your client programmer can explain your exception in a way that helps the user, then you should probably not be using a checked exception.\n\n\nSo those are my rules. Somewhat contrived, and there will doubtless be exceptions (please help me refine them if you will). But my main argument is that there are cases like FileNotFoundException where the checked exception is as important and useful a part of the API contract as the parameter types. So we should not dispense with it just because it is misused. \n\nSorry, didn&#39;t mean to make this so long and waffly. Let me finish with two suggestions:\n\nA: API programmers: use checked exceptions sparingly to preserve their usefulness. When in doubt use an unchecked exception.\n\nB: Client programmers: get in the habit of creating a wrapped exception (google it) early on in your development. Jdk 1.4 and later provide a constructor in RuntimeException for this, but you can easily create your own too. Here&#39;s the constuctor:\n\n\n\nThen get in the habit of whenever you have to handle a checked exception and you&#39;re feeling lazy (or you think the API programmer was overzealous in using the checked exception in the first place), don&#39;t just swallow the exception, wrap it and rethrow it.\n\n\n\nPut this in one of your IDE&#39;s little code templates and use it when you&#39;re feeling lazy. This way if you really need to handle the checked exception you&#39;ll be forced to come back and deal with it after seeing the problem at runtime. Because, believe me (and Anders Hejlsberg) you&#39;re never going to come back to that TODO in your\n\n\n",

        "body": "The theory for checked exceptions is simple.\n\nWhen designing an interface, think of exceptional cases that can occur, and will occur, with the normal state of a method call.  Declare these exceptions in your interface, as the programmer will have to handle them directly.\n\nFor example, a bank account withdraw method may declare an OverdraftException, which is an expected exception - a withdrawal may fail due to overdraft, but this type of failure may be handled differently by the client code (one may decide to completely deny the withdrawal, another may decide to apply a huge penalty and allow for a negative balance to be recorded, another may decide that their client is allowed to draw from a different account).\n\nHowever, runtime exceptions were supposed to be programming errors that weren&#39;t supposed to be handled directly - such as NullPointerExceptions, which only occur if methods take invalid arguments or don&#39;t check for such cases directly.\n\nThis is a good theory.  However, Java messed up with its implementation of Exceptions, and this threw the book of this theory out the window.\n\nThere are two cases that I will illustrate where Java messed up with its implementation of Exceptions.  These are IOException and SQLException.\n\nAn IOException occurs anytime, anywhere a stream in the IO libraries of Java messes up.  This is a checked exception, however.  But, generally you cannot do anything but log that an error occur - if you&#39;re simply writing to the console, what can you reasonably be expected to do if you suddenly get an IOException when you&#39;re writing to it?\n\nBut there&#39;s more.\n\nIOException also hides stuff like file exceptions and network exceptions.  They may be subclasses of IOException floating around for that, but it is still a checked exception.  If your writing to an external file fails, you can&#39;t really do much about it - if your network connection is severed, ditto.\n\nSQLException is the same way.  Exception names should show what happened when they are called.  SQLException does not.  SQLException is thrown any single time any possible number of errors are encountered when dealing with a database - MOST OF WHICH THAT HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH SQL.\n\nTherefore, programmers typically get annoyed with handling exceptions, and let Eclipse (or whatever IDE they&#39;re using) generate blocks like this:\n\n\n\nHowever, with RuntimeExceptions, these intentionally bubble up and eventually get handled by the JVM or container level.  This is a good thing - it forces errors to show up and then you must fix the code directly instead of ignoring the exception - you may still end up just printing the stack trace (hopefully logging it instead of printing to the console directly), but then there will be an exception handler that you were forced to write because of a real problem - not because a method said that it might possibly throw an Exception, but that it did.\n\nSpring uses a DataAccessException to wrap SQLExceptions so that you don&#39;t have to handle them as a checked exception.  It makes code much cleaner as a result - if you expect a DataAccessException, you can handle it - but most of the time you let it propagate and be logged as an error, because your SQL should be debugged by the time you release your application, meaning the DataAccessException is probably a hardware issue that you could not resolve - DataAccessException is a much more meaningful name than SQLException, because it shows that access to data failed - not that your SQL query was nessecarily at fault.\n",

It is often the case that allowing an NPE to be thrown from your method is the most reasonable thing you can do in the event that some reference it tries to use is unexpectedly .  Certainly the standard library takes that approach in many places.  The most likely reason to &quot;need&quot; to verify that every reference is non- is an artificial standard imposed from outside.\n\n\n  My Question / Thought is , is there a way in Java to CREATE a method which takes an expression and evaluate if it throw NullPointerException and if yes then return a default value say blank &quot; &quot; .\n\n\nI hesitate to say that it&#39;s impossible, but certainly there is no easy way to write a general-purpose method such as you describe.  Java makes no provision for evaluating Java source code at runtime.  Besides, what would be the point?  Instead of invoking such a method, you can just execute the code inside a  block; if it throws an NPE then catch it, and handle the situation however is appropriate.  There is no need to pre-test the expression.\n\n\n  How can I pass the expression to the method and ask Java to evaluate it inside method only?\n\n\nYou cannot.  Or at least, Java makes no provision for it, as I already said.  Whatever expression you use as a method argument is evaluated before the method is invoked, and a copy of the result is passed to the method.  Again, use a  /  directly -- pretty much anything else you could consider doing is far more complicated and more costly.\n\nAlternatively, there are approaches such as @PeterLawrey&#39;s that make it easier and prettier to test every single reference.  That&#39;s not what you asked, but perhaps it suits you.\n",

The Configurable tag is not necessary, because I am autowiring and do not need to create a new object. \n\nUPDATE\n\nHere is where I am calling CCDAuthorizingRealm. I&#39;m new to using Shiro, but I&#39;m pretty sure this is correct.\n\n\n\nI currently try creating a new instance of my realm in the controller. I do this because when I try:\n\n\n\nI would get a runtime error when initializing the Security Manager because it would complain about realm being null. I don&#39;t understand why realm is null, however, since it is annotated as a component. Perhaps this is the root of my problem.\n",

        "body": "Avoid old date-time classes\n\nYou are using the old date-time classes that have proven to be poorly designed, confusing, and troublesome. Avoid them.\n\njava.time\n\nUse the java.time framework built into Java 8 and later. See Tutorial. For Java 6 &amp; 7, use the ThreeTen-Backport project. For Android, the adaptation of that back-port, ThreeTenABP.\n\nHere is some example code to get you going. I only whipped this up impromptu, so it may not be robust. This code does seem to work for your one example usage:\n\n\n  (Friday 18:00) + 48 = (Tuseday 18:00) (Saturday and Sunday are ignored)\n\n\nI generalized this code a bit. Rather than a number of hours, it takes a  for any span of time (internally represented as a total number of seconds plus a fraction of second in nanoseconds). You will notice the output of the  method uses standard ISO 8601 notation such as  for your example amount of 48 hours.\n\nAssuming you want real moments on the time line, we need to use a time zone to account for anomalies such as Daylight Saving Time (DST). For that we need to start with a  which combines a moment on the timeline in UTC () with a time zone ().\n\nWe also pass a duration such as 48 hours, and a set of day-of-week values such as Saturday &amp; Sunday. Skip past this method for a discussion of these types below.\n\nThe strategy in this method is to take our duration such as 48 hours and chip away at it one day at a time by an amount necessary to get to the beginning of the following day. If that next day happens to be a prohibited day-of-week, we slide to the following day after that, and keep sliding until we reach an allowed (not prohibited) day-of-week date. We continue to nibble away at our remaining amount of time until it reaches zero. Read comments in the code for more discussion.\n\nWhen calculating the start of the next day, do not assume that time-of-day will be . The day may start at another time because of Daylight Saving Time (DST) and perhaps other anomalies in certain time zones. We call  to let java.time determine the first moment of the day.\n\n\n\nTo invoke that code, we will use your example data values. As one way of getting the raw data input, we parse a string into . \n\n\n\nThat  object does not represent an actual moment on the timeline. So we apply a time zone to get an actual moment, a .\n\n\n\nI also generalized from &quot;the weekend&quot; to any set of day-of-week values rather than hard-coding for Saturday &amp; Sunday. The java.time classes include a handy enum,  -- much better than using strings or numbers in our code. \n\nThe enum facility in Java is vastly more flexible and useful than the simple number-masked-as-constant in most languages. Among its feature is a special  implementation  for when you want to collect a subset of the possible items defined by your enum. For us here, we want to collect a pair of items, for the Saturday item and the Sunday item.\n\n\n\nPerhaps the working days are a four-day week such as Monday-Tuesday plus Thursday-Friday, then use .\n\nNow we are ready to call our calculation method. Pass three arguments:\n\n\nThe starting \nA  to be added to the starting date-time\nAn  of  items.\n\n\nWe get back our calculated future date-time.\n\n\n\nDump to console.\n\n\n\n\n  zdt: 2016-01-01T18:00-05:00[America/Montreal] plus duration: PT48H while skipping daysOfWeek: [SATURDAY, SUNDAY] is zdtLater: 2016-01-05T18:00-05:00[America/Montreal]\n\n",

        "body": "Consider the following service (transactional by default).  A player must always have one account.  A player without at least one corresponding account is an error state.\n\n\n\nI have seen this pattern by experienced grails developers, and when I tell them that if creation of the account of the player fails for any reason, it wont rollback the player, and will leave the DB in an invalid state, they look at me like I am mad because grails handles rolling back the player because services are transactional right?\n\nSo then, being a SQL guy, I look for a way to call rollback in grails.  There isn&#39;t one.  According to various posts, there are only 2 ways to force grails to rollback in a service:\n\n\nthrow an unchecked exception.  You know what this is right?\ndon&#39;t use service methods or transactional annotations, use this construct:\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n1. throw an unchecked exception\n\n\n\n1.1 So we must throw runtime exceptions to rollback.  This is ok for me (I like exceptions), but this wont gel with the grails developers we have who view exceptions as a throwback to Java and is uncool.  It also means we have to change the whole way the app currently uses its service layer.\n\n1.2 If an exception is thrown, you lose the p.errors - you lose the validation detail.\n\n1.3 Our new grails devs don&#39;t know the difference between an unchecked and an checked exception, and don&#39;t know how to tell the difference.  This is really dangerous.\n\n1.4. use .save(failOnError: true)\nI am a big fan of using this, but its not appropriate everywhere. Sometimes you need to check the reason before going further, not throw an exception.  Are the exceptions it can generate always checked, always unchecked, or either?  I.e. will failOnError AWLAYS rollback, no matter what the cause?  No one I have asked knows the answer to this, which is disturbing, they are using blind faith to avoid corrupted/inconsistent DBs.\n\n1.5 What happens if a controller calls service A, which calls Service B, then service C.  Service A must catch any exception and return a nicely formatted return value to the controller.  If Service C throws an exception, which is caught by Service A, will service Bs transactions be rolled back?  This is critical to know to be able to construct a working application.\n\nUPDATE 1:\nHaving done some tests, it appears that any runtime exception, even if thrown and caught in some unrelated child calls, will cause everything in the parent to rollback.  However, it is not easy to know in the parent session that this rollback has happened - you need to make sure that if you catch any exception, you either rethrow, or pass some notice back to the caller to show that it has failed in such a way that everything else will be rolled back. \n\n2. withTransaction\n\n\n\n2.1 This seems a bazaar construct. How do I call this, and what do I pass in for the &quot;status&quot; parameter?  What is &quot;setRollbackOnly&quot; exactly.  Why is it not just called &quot;rollback&quot;.  What is the &quot;Only&quot; part?  It is tied to a domain object, when your method may want to do update several different domain objects.\n\n2.2 Where are you supposed to put this code? In with the DomainObject class?  In the source folder (i.e. not in a service or controller?)? Directly in the controller? (we don&#39;t want to duplicate business logic in the controllers)\n\n3. Ideal situation.\n\n\n\n3.1 The general case is we want every thing we do in a service method to roll back if anything in that service method cant be saved for any reason, or throws any exception for any reason (checked or unchecked).\n\n3.2 Ideally I would like service methods to &quot;always rollback, unless I explicitly call commit&quot;, which is the safest strategy , but this is not possible I believe.\n\nThe question is how do I achieve the ideal situation?\n\nWill calling save(failOnError:true) ALWAYS rollback everything, no matter what the reason for failing?  This is not perfect, as it is not easy for the caller  to know which domain object save caused the issue.\n\nOr do people define lots of exception classes which subclass runtimeException, then explicit catch each of them in the controller to create the appropriate response?  This is the old Java way, and our groovy devs pooh pooh this approach due to the amount of boiler plate code we will have to write.\n\nWhat methods do people use to achieve this?\n",

I&#39;m just now refactoring some controllers to use services in order to take advantage of transactions.\n\n\n  I have seen this pattern by experienced grails developers, and when I tell them that if creation of the account of the player fails for any reason, it wont rollback the player, and will leave the DB in an invalid state, they look at me like I am mad because grails handles rolling back the player because services are transactional right?\n\n\nI&#39;m not seeing in the documentation where it explicitly states that returning from a service method does not rollback the transaction, but I can&#39;t imagine that this would be a very sane behavior. Still, testing is an easy way to prove yourself.\n\n\n  1.2 If an exception is thrown, you lose the p.errors - you lose the validation detail.\n\n\nSince you&#39;re the one throwing the exception, you can throw the errors along with it. For instance:\n\n\n\nWhen you catch the exception, you reload the instance (because throwing an exception clears the session), put the errors back into the instance, and then pass that to the view as usual:\n\n\n\nThis is discussed under the heading &quot;Validation Errors and Rollback&quot;, down the page from http://grails.github.io/grails-doc/2.4.4/guide/single.html#transactionsRollbackAndTheSession.\n\n\n  1.4. use .save(failOnError: true) I am a big fan of using this, but its not appropriate everywhere.

Instead, you check whether  failed (), and take action based on that.\n\n\n  \n  withTransaction\n  \n\n\nI&#39;m not sure the point of this, because SpringSource really encourages the use of services for everything. I personally don&#39;t like it, either.\n\nIf you want to make a particular service non-transactional, and then make one method of it transactional, you can just annotate that one method with  (unless your developers also dislike annotations because they&#39;re too &quot;Java&quot; ;) ).\n\nNote! As soon as you mark a single method with , the overall service will become non-transactional. \n\n\n  3.1 The general case is we want every thing we do in a service method to roll back if anything in that service method cant be saved for any reason, or throws any exception for any reason (checked or unchecked).\n\n\nI feel like checked exceptions are generally considered not &quot;Groovy&quot; (which also makes them not Grails-y). Not sure about the reason for that.\n\nHowever, it looks like you can tell your service to rollback on your checked exceptions, by listing them in the  option to .\n\n\n  Or do people define lots of exception classes which subclass runtimeException, then explicit catch each of them in the controller to create the appropriate response? This is the old Java way, and our groovy devs pooh pooh this approach due to the amount of boiler plate code we will have to write.\n\n\nThe nice thing about Groovy is that you can write your boiler plate once and then call it repeatedly. A pattern I&#39;ve seen a lot, and am currently using, is something like this:\n\n\n\nAnd then call it in each controller action like so:\n\n\n\n( is another similar method that DRYs up the check for existence and optimistic locking.)\n\nThis approach has downsides. You get the same set of redirects in every action; you probably want to write one set of methods for each controller; and it seems kind of silly to pass a closure into a method and expect the method to know what exceptions the closure will throw.  But hey, programming&#39;s all about tradeoffs, right?\n\nAnyway, hope that is at least interesting.\n",

(Like the burst mode in Camera2, but I&#39;m working on older versions.)\nIt is implemented by takePicture() / onPictureTaken() callback, and work normally on several devices except some performance issues. However I got a RuntimeException of startPreview failed on an HTC Sensation device when trying to start preview for the 2nd picture.\n\nHere is the functions about multiple shot:\n\n\n\nAfter the first picture being taken, the startPreview() function may fail in a rate of 10-20% on the specified device. My APP is always run in foreground and has a visible view to show the preview frames. I also try to bypass the JPEG data without processing it, but the error still occurs.\n\nI found a similar report at here. It seems that the underlying thread for taking picture does not finish its works, but we have no way to check it. So I try to catch the exception from startPreview() and sleep a while:\n\n\n\nBut once startPreview fails, it will fail forever no matter how many times I sleep.\n\nI also found that you need to call setType(SurfaceHolder.SURFACE_TYPE_PUSH_BUFFERS) for the surface holder in older Android versions to let startPreview() work correctly. But the device has Android version 4.0.3 and should not require this call. I still try to add it but the issue remains the same. Moreover, the first call of startPreview() works correctly while the second call after onPictureTaken() gets the error. This is different from the issue of missing setType() in older versions.\n\nFinally I use an workaround that may greatly hurt the performance:\n\n\n\nThat is, when startPreview() fails, I just close the camera, reopen it with the same settings, then start the preview to take another picture.\n\nI want to know if I miss something about the take picture APIs, and is there a solution better than this brute-force workaround.\n",

Nowadays APIs are depending more on Runtime exceptions as they want to leave on the caller to decide whether the exception gets caught. Many APIs impose you to catch many exceptions which leads to a lot of pain when you know that exception is never going to occur. You are forced to catch it and leave an empty catch block or better log that it should not occur. \n\nThe APIs do however specifically document when a particular exception is meant to occur.\n\nTake an example of  which throws  and which is a Runtime exception, in most scenarios when I have used it I always catch it and do some recovery using default values.\n\nThink of the scenario if  would have been a checked exception, and you making a call , it is clearly visible that it won&#39;t occur but still you will be forced to catch it. Agreed that the example is a hypothetical one, but gets my point through.\n\nAgain this is just my opinion based on my experience.\n\n\n  I&#39;m asking if they ever get handled differently.\n\n\nAs I have wrote NPE is not caught in most scenarios, but there are always exceptions. Like suppose there is a part of your system that is kept open for extension for someone else to program and there is NPE in that code and you don&#39;t want the upper layers to be affected by it then I catch NPE and remove that component from the system giving proper logs and traces.

My app has a bunch of Thing objects, each of which has a bitmap, and each one changes the bitmap somehow (change the color, size, etc).  This all worked fine with some &quot;test&quot; bitmaps I made in MS Paint (saved as .png files).  However, when I replaced them with nicer pictures made in GIMP, the app started crashing.  \n\nEventually I figured out that the app would only crash if the .png image is saved with &quot;Save background color&quot; checked in GIMP.  I need this, as some of these pictures need to be partially transparent so they can be overlaid.  However: the crazy thing is, it is not crashing when I try to overlay an image, or create one, it&#39;s crashing when I apply the ColorMatrixColorFilter to the Paint object.\n\nI don&#39;t understand how that can be.  It never gets far enough to actually apply the Paint object to anything, so why would one image file work, but another one wouldn&#39;t?  The crash is a RuntimeException in ActivityThread.performLauncActivity and I haven&#39;t been able to find out anything more about it.  \n\nHere&#39;s some pseudocode of exactly what I&#39;m doing and where it&#39;s crashing.  \n\nQuestions:\n1) Why is this crashing?\n2) What should I be doing differently if I want to load transparent images and apply color filters, overlay them on each other to create new bitmaps, etc?  All of this works fine as long as all of my images have no background.\n\n\n\nEdit 1: Here&#39;s the trace, in case it&#39;s helpful:\n    DalvikVM[localhost:8611]\n    Thread [&lt;1&gt; main] (Suspended (exception RuntimeException))\n    ActivityThread.performLaunchActivity(ActivityThread$ActivityRecord, Intent) line: 2663\n    ActivityThread.handleLaunchActivity(ActivityThread$ActivityRecord, Intent) line: 2679\n    ActivityThread.access$2300(ActivityThread, ActivityThread$ActivityRecord, Intent) line: 125 \n    ActivityThread$H.handleMessage(Message) line: 2033\n    ActivityThread$H(Handler).dispatchMessage(Message) line: 99 \n    Looper.loop() line: 123 \n    ActivityThread.main(String[]) line: 4627\n    Method.invokeNative(Object, Object[], Class, Class[], Class, int, boolean) line: not available [native method]\n    Method.invoke(Object, Object...) line: 521\n    ZygoteInit$MethodAndArgsCaller.run() line: 868\n    ZygoteInit.main(String[]) line: 626 \n    NativeStart.main(String[]) line: not available [native method]  \n\nEdit 2: This occurred using a 2.2 target (specifically, android-x86-2.2-eeepc running in VirtualBox).

Both states indicate that the ServerSocket is not valid anymore.\n\nSo for this class, generally, if you fail with an exception, always try to gracefully close the ServerSocket in a finally block and then recreate it.\n\nAdditionally on your Java-wide question scope: Always look into the source and understand what the interface is doing. If it is mission-critical write tests that reproduce the behaviour (should not be easy at all with such a low-level api).\n\nFinally - is Java consistently doing such things that way? No. Some classes are stateless, others are not (like ServerSocket), some are thread-safe, others not. And you need to understand - either from the documentation or (mostly) from the code - what state they build in order to understand what to do when an Exception knocks you off from the main path.\n\nMost people curse those checked Java exceptions, because most of them (as with most of the IOExceptions) are not really recoverable in a meaningful way. Most of the time, they argue, you cannot understand each and every fine corner case. Which is the reason why many complex frameworks may retry twice or thrice if they think in this case they might, but finally throw a RuntimeException to a top framework layer. There  they make something useful out of it (a meaningful error providing context) and log all the details they have, which is a huge stack trace most of the time. A great resource of knowledge, feared by many developers.\n\nSo what can you do if you could not recover from an untested corner-case problem?

        "body": "Assertions are popular in languages without exception handling, for making checks to ensure the program is operating correctly, so as to make problems easier to diagnose.\n\nHowever there can be some ambiguity as to what the most appropriate cause of action is if an assertion fires. If the program exits immediately, there may have been a wasted opportunity to handle the failure more gracefully (e.g. reporting the failure to the user and attempting to recover data). If the program does not exit immediately, it could be in an unknown state because of the error, which is also undesirable.\n\nAs a result it is considered better practice to throw exceptions in Java when a given condition fails, which allows a best-of-both-worlds solution to these problems. For errors that can occur during normal operation of the program, checked exceptions most appropriate. Calling code is obliged to handle these errors. For errors caused by failure internal program logic, throwing a RuntimeException would allow the program to handle the failure appropriately further up the call stack.\n\nAsserts do have one benefit which is they can be employed in development, but can be &#39;compiled out&#39; for a consumer or release build, where speed of execution is more of a priority than early detection and handling of errors. However apps that require that characteristic are not commonly built in Java (more likely C++), which is again why assert is rare in Java.\n\n(Also, I believe that assets at runtime are not always enabled by default by some IDEs anyway, so it is easy to have an assertion fail and not know about it.)\n",

        "body": "This feature would just cause havoc and confusion. Forcing the unload of a class would bring a lot of problems, like deprecated Thread.stop() had, except that would be many more times worse.\n\nJust for comparing, Thread.stop() tends to leave a lot of objects in inconsistent states due to the abrupt thread interrupting, and the thread could be executing any type of code. Coding against that in practice is impossible, or at least an tremendous extreme effort. It is considered between almost impossible and completely impossible to write a correct multithreded code in that scenario.\n\nIn your case, that sort of feature would have similar bad side-effects, but in much worse scale. The code could get the exception anywhere unexpectedly, so in practice would be very difficult or impossible to code defensively against it or handle it. Suppose that you have a try block doing some IO, and then a class is abruptely unloaded. The code will throw a ClassUnloadedException in an unexpected place, potentially leaving objects in inconsistent states. If you try to defend your code against it, the code responsible for that defense might fail as well due to another unexpected ClassUnloadedException. If you have a finally block that tries to close a resource and a ClassUnloadedException is thrown inside that block, the resource could not be closed. And again, handling it would be very hard, because the handler could get a ClassUnloadedException too.\n\nBy the way, NullPointerException is completely predictable. You got a pointer to something null and tried to derefence it. Normally it is a programming error, but the behaviour is completelly predictable. ClassCastException, IllegalStateException, IllegalArgumentException and other RuntimeExceptions are (or at least should be) happening in predictable conditions. Exceptions which are not RuntimeException may happen unexpectedly sometimes (like IOException), but the compiler forces you to handle or rethrow them.\n\nOn the other hand, StackOverflowError, OutOfMemoryError, ExceptionIninitializerError and NoClassDefFoundError, are unpredictable things that may happen anywhere in the code and very rarely there is something possible to do to handle or recover from them. When some program hits that, normally they just go erratic crazy. The few ones that try to handle them, limits to warning the user that it must be terminated immediatelly, maybe trying to save the unsaved data. Your ClassUnloadedException is a typical thing that would be a ClassUnloadedError instead. It would manifest itself like a ExceptionIninitializerError or NoClassDefFoundError which in 99% of the cases means just that your application is completely broken, except that it would be much worse because it has not a fail-fast behaviour, and so it gets still more randomness and unpredictableness to it.\n\nDynamic redeployment is by its very nature, one of the most ugly hacks that may happens in a JVM/Container since it changes abruptely the code of something that is already running on it, which tends to get you to a very erratic random buggy behavior. But it has its value, since it helps a lot in debugging. So, a defense against erratic behavior that the container implements, is to create a new set of classes to the running program and shares memory with the older one. If the new and the old parts of your program don&#39;t communicate directly (i.e., just by compatible serialization or by no communication at all), you are fine. You are normally safe too if no structural changes occurs and no living object depends of some specific implementation detail that changed. If you do follow these rules, no ClassUnloadedError will be show. However there are some situations where you may not follow these rules and still be safe, like fixing a bug in a method and changing its parameters and no live object exists which depends on the bug (i.e., they never existed or they are all dead).\n\nBut if you really wants a ClassUnloadedError being thrown if an object of the older part is accessed, as this behaviour flags that one of that isolament rules were broke, and then bring everything down. So, there is no point in have new and old parts of the program in the same time, it would be simpler to just redeploy it completely.\n\nAnd about the implementation in the GC, it does not works. A dead object is dead, no matter if its class object is dead too or alive. The living objects of unloaded classes can&#39;t be garbage collected, because they are still reachable to other objects, no matter if the implementation of every method will magically change to something that always throws an Exception/Error. Backtracking the references to the object would be a very expensive operation in any implementation, and multithreading this would be still worse, possibly with a severe performance hit in perfectly living objects and classes.\n\nFurther, dynamic loading classes are not intended for production use, just for developer tests. So, it is no worth to buy all that trouble and complexity for this feature.\n\nConcluding, in practice your idea creates something that combines something similar to Thread.stop() with something similar to NoClassdefFoundError, but is stronger than the sum of the two. Like a queen is a combination of a bishop and a rook in chess, but is stronger than the sum of the two. It is a really bad idea.\n",

This should ensure they are synchronised.\nRelated to the above, there is an enhancement for rx-scala in the works (https://github.com/Netflix/RxJava/issues/815#issuecomment-38793433) which would allow specification of an observable&#39;s scheduler implicitly.\nFutures fit in nicely into Akka with the  pattern. A similar pattern can be used for Observables (see bottom of this post). This also solves the problem of sending messages to remote observables.\n\n\nNow the caveats:\n\n\nThey share the same problems as the future. See, for example, the bottom of page : http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.3.2/general/jmm.html. Also the chapter on Futures in Wyatt 2013.\nAs in @mavilein&#39;s answer, this means that  should not use the enclosing scope of an Actor to access it&#39;s internal state. For example, you shouldn&#39;t call  in a subscription. Instead, store it into a val, and then access this val, as in the example below.\nThe resolution of the scheduler used by Akka is different from Rx. It&#39;s default resolution is 100 ms (Wyatt 2013). If anybody has had experience with what problems this can cause, please comment below!\n\n\nFinally, I&#39;ve implemented the equivalent of the  pattern for Observables. It uses  or  to return an Observable asynchronously, backed by a temporary actor and a  behind the scenes. Note that, the messages sent by the source are of type  using , so they satisfy the complete and error states in the observable contract. Otherwise we have no way of signaling these states to the sink. However, there is nothing stopping you from sending arbitrtrary types of messages; these will simply call . The observable has a timeout that stops with a timeout exception if messages are not received in a certain interval.\n\nIt&#39;s used like so:\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd produces this output:\n\n\n\nThe source follows. It&#39;s a modified version of AskSupport.scala.\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdate 2015-09-10\n\nThought I&#39;d add here some simpler code to implement the  operator. This is slightly different form the above as a) it doesn&#39;t support over-the-network data and b) it returns , which makes it easier to synchronize responses. The advantage is that it doesn&#39;t mess with the Akka innards:\n\n\n\n\n",

        "body": "I think I read the same Bruce Eckel interview that you did - and it&#39;s always bugged me. In fact, the argument was made by the interviewee (if this is indeed the post you&#39;re talking about) Anders Hejlsberg, the MS genius behind .Net and C#.\n\nhttp://www.artima.com/intv/handcuffs.html\n\nFan though I am of Hejlsberg and his work, this argument has always struck me as bogus. It basically boils down to: \n\n&quot;Checked exceptions are bad because programmers just abuse them by always catching them and dismissing them which leads to problems being hidden and ignored that would otherwise be presented to the user&quot;. \n\nBy &quot;otherwise presented to the user&quot; I mean if you use a runtime exception the lazy programmer will just ignore it (versus catching it with an empty catch block) and the user will see it.\n\nThe summary of the summary of the argument is that &quot;Programmers wont use them properly and not using them properly is worse than not having them&quot;.\n\nThere is some truth to this argument and in fact I suspect Goslings motivation for not putting operator overrides in Java comes from a similar argument - they confuse the programmer because they are often abused.\n\nBut in the end I find it a bogus argument of Hejlsbergs and possibly a post-hoc one created to explain the lack rather than a well thought out decision.\n\nI would argue that while the over-use of checked exceptions is a bad thing and tends to lead to sloppy handling by users, but the proper use of them allows the API programmer to give great benefit to the API client programmer.\n\nNow the API programmer has to be careful not to throw checked exceptions all over the place, or they will simply annoy the client programmer. The very lazy client programmer will resort to catch (Exception) {} as Hejlsberg warns and all benefit will be lost and hell will ensue.\nBut in some circumstances there&#39;s just no substitute for a good checked exception. \n\nFor me the classic example is the file-open API. Every programming language in the history of languages (on file systems at least) has an API somewhere that lets you open a file. And every client programmer using this API knows that they have to deal with the case that the file they are trying to open doesn&#39;t exist. \nLet me rephrase that: Every client programmer using this API should know that they have to deal with this case. \nAnd there&#39;s the rub: can the API progammer help them know they should deal with it through commenting alone or can they indeed insist the client deal with it.\n\nIn C the idiom goes something like\n\n\n\nwhere fopen indicates failure by returning 0 and C (foolishly) lets you treat 0 as a boolean and... Basically you learn this idiom and you&#39;re okay. But what if you&#39;re a noob and you didn&#39;t learn the idiom. Then of course you start out with\n\n\n\nand learn the hard way.\n\nNote that we&#39;re only talking about strongly typed languages here: There&#39;s a clear idea of what an API is in a strongly typed language: It&#39;s a smorgasbord of functionality (methods) for you to use with a clearly defined protocol for each one.\n\nThat clearly defined protocol is typically defined by a method signature. \nHere fopen requires that you pass it a string (or a char* in the case of C). If you give it something else you get a compile-time error. You didn&#39;t follow the protocol - you&#39;re not using the API properly.\n\nIn some (obscure) languages the return type is part of the protocol too. If you try to call the equivalent of fopen() in some languages without assigning it to a variable you&#39;ll also get a compile time error (you can only do that with void functions).\n\nThe point I&#39;m trying to make is that: In a statically typed language the API programmer encourages the client to use the API properly by preventing their client code from compiling if it makes any obvious mistakes.\n\n(In a dynamically typed language, like Ruby, you can pass anything, say a float, as the file name - and it will compile. Why hassle the user with checked exceptions if you&#39;re not even going to control the method arguments. The arguments made here apply to statically-typed langauges only)\n\nSo, what about checked exceptions?\n\nWell here&#39;s one of the Java APIs you can use for opening a file.\n\n\n\nSee that catch? Here&#39;s the signature for that API method:\n\n\n\nNote that FileNotFoundException is a checked exception.\n\nThe API programmer is saying this to you:\n  &quot;You may use this constructor to create a new FileInputStream but you \n\na) must pass in the file name as a\n    String\nb) must accept the\n    possibility that the file might not\n    be found at runtime&quot;\n\nAnd that&#39;s the whole point as far as I&#39;m concerned.\n\nThe key is basically what the question states as &quot;Things that are out of the programmers control&quot; My first thought was that he/she means things that are out of the API programmers control. But in fact, checked exceptions when used properly should really be for things that are out of both the client programmer&#39;s and the API programmer&#39;s control. I think this is the key to not abusing checked exceptions.\n\nI think the file-open illustrates the point nicely. The API programmer knows you might give them a file name that turns out to be nonexistent at the time the API is called, and that they won&#39;t be able to return you what you wanted, but will have to throw an exception. They also know that this will happen pretty regularly and that the client programmer might expect the file name to be correct at the time they wrote the call, but it might be wrong at runtime for reasons beyond their control too.\n\nSo the API makes it explicit: There will be cases where this file doesn&#39;t exist at the time you call me and you had damn well better deal with it.\n\nThis would be clearer with a counter-case. Imagine I&#39;m writing a table API. I have  table model somewhere with an API with this method:\n\n\n\nNow as an API programmer I know there will be cases where some client passes in a negative value for the row or a row value outside of the table. So I might be tempted to throw a checked exception and force the client to deal with it:\n\n\n\n(I wouldn&#39;t really call it &quot;Checked&quot; of course).\n\nThis is bad use of checked exceptions. The client code is going to be full of calls to fetch row data, every one of which is going to have to use a try/catch, and for what? Are they going to report to the user that the wrong row was sought? Probably not - because whatever the UI surrounding my table view is, it shouldn&#39;t let the user get into a state where an illegal row is being requested. So it&#39;s a bug on the part of the client programmer. \n\nThe API programmer can still predict that the client will code such bugs and should handle it with a runtime exception like an IllegalArgumentException. \n\nWith a checked exception in getRowData, this is clearly a case that&#39;s going to lead to Hejlsbergs lazy programmer simply adding empty catches. When that happens, the illegal row values will not be obvious even to the tester or the client developer debugging, rather they&#39;ll lead to knock-on errors that are hard to pinpoint the source of. Arianne rockets will blow up after launch. \n\nOkay, so here&#39;s the problem: I&#39;m saying that the checked exception FileNotFoundException is not just a good thing but an essential tool in the API programmers toolbox for defining the API in the most useful way for the client programmer. But the CheckedInvalidRowNumberException is a big inconvenience, leading to bad programming and should be avoided. But how to tell the difference. \n\nI guess it&#39;s not an exact science and I guess that underlies and perhaps justifies to a certain extent Hejlsbergs argument. But I&#39;m not happy throwing the baby out with the bathwater here, so allow me to extract some rules here to distinguish good checked exceptions from bad:\n\n\nOut of clients control or Closed vs Open: \n\nChecked exceptions should only be used where the error case is out of control of both the API and the client programmer.\nThis has to do with how open or closed the system is. In a constrained UI where the client programmer has control, say, over all of the buttons, keyboard commands etc that add and delete rows from the table view, (a closed system) it is a client programming bug if it attempts to fetch data from a nonexistent row. In a file based operating system where any number of users/applications can add and delete files (an open system) it is conceivable that the file the client is requesting has been deleted without their knowledge so they should be expected to deal with it.  \nUbiquity:\n\nChecked exceptions should not be used on an API call that is made frequently by the client.\nBy frequently I mean from a lot of places in the client code - not frequently in time. So a client code doesn&#39;t tend to try to open the same file a lot, but my table view gets RowData all over the place from different methods. In particular I&#39;m going to be writing a lot of code like\n\nif (model.getRowData().getCell(0).isEmpty())\n\nand it will be painful to have to wrap in try/catch every time.\nInforming the User:\n\nChecked exceptions should be used in cases where you can imagine a useful error message being presented to the end user. \nThis is the &quot;and what will you when it happens?&quot; question I raise above. It also relates to item 1. Since you can predict that something outside of your client-API system might cause the file to not be there, you can reasonably tell the user about it:\n\n&quot;Error: could not find the file &#39;goodluckfindingthisfile&#39;&quot;\n\nSince your illegal row number was caused by an internal bug and through no fault of the user, there&#39;s really no useful information you can give them. If your app doesn&#39;t let runtime exceptions fall through to the console it will probably end up giving them some ugly message like:\n\n&quot;Internal error occured: IllegalArgumentException in ....&quot;\n\nIn short, if you don&#39;t think your client programmer can explain your exception in a way that helps the user, then you should probably not be using a checked exception.\n\n\nSo those are my rules. Somewhat contrived, and there will doubtless be exceptions (please help me refine them if you will). But my main argument is that there are cases like FileNotFoundException where the checked exception is as important and useful a part of the API contract as the parameter types. So we should not dispense with it just because it is misused. \n\nSorry, didn&#39;t mean to make this so long and waffly. Let me finish with two suggestions:\n\nA: API programmers: use checked exceptions sparingly to preserve their usefulness. When in doubt use an unchecked exception.\n\nB: Client programmers: get in the habit of creating a wrapped exception (google it) early on in your development. Jdk 1.4 and later provide a constructor in RuntimeException for this, but you can easily create your own too. Here&#39;s the constuctor:\n\n\n\nThen get in the habit of whenever you have to handle a checked exception and you&#39;re feeling lazy (or you think the API programmer was overzealous in using the checked exception in the first place), don&#39;t just swallow the exception, wrap it and rethrow it.\n\n\n\nPut this in one of your IDE&#39;s little code templates and use it when you&#39;re feeling lazy. This way if you really need to handle the checked exception you&#39;ll be forced to come back and deal with it after seeing the problem at runtime. Because, believe me (and Anders Hejlsberg) you&#39;re never going to come back to that TODO in your\n\n\n",

        "body": "The theory for checked exceptions is simple.\n\nWhen designing an interface, think of exceptional cases that can occur, and will occur, with the normal state of a method call.  Declare these exceptions in your interface, as the programmer will have to handle them directly.\n\nFor example, a bank account withdraw method may declare an OverdraftException, which is an expected exception - a withdrawal may fail due to overdraft, but this type of failure may be handled differently by the client code (one may decide to completely deny the withdrawal, another may decide to apply a huge penalty and allow for a negative balance to be recorded, another may decide that their client is allowed to draw from a different account).\n\nHowever, runtime exceptions were supposed to be programming errors that weren&#39;t supposed to be handled directly - such as NullPointerExceptions, which only occur if methods take invalid arguments or don&#39;t check for such cases directly.\n\nThis is a good theory.  However, Java messed up with its implementation of Exceptions, and this threw the book of this theory out the window.\n\nThere are two cases that I will illustrate where Java messed up with its implementation of Exceptions.  These are IOException and SQLException.\n\nAn IOException occurs anytime, anywhere a stream in the IO libraries of Java messes up.  This is a checked exception, however.  But, generally you cannot do anything but log that an error occur - if you&#39;re simply writing to the console, what can you reasonably be expected to do if you suddenly get an IOException when you&#39;re writing to it?\n\nBut there&#39;s more.\n\nIOException also hides stuff like file exceptions and network exceptions.  They may be subclasses of IOException floating around for that, but it is still a checked exception.  If your writing to an external file fails, you can&#39;t really do much about it - if your network connection is severed, ditto.\n\nSQLException is the same way.  Exception names should show what happened when they are called.  SQLException does not.  SQLException is thrown any single time any possible number of errors are encountered when dealing with a database - MOST OF WHICH THAT HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH SQL.\n\nTherefore, programmers typically get annoyed with handling exceptions, and let Eclipse (or whatever IDE they&#39;re using) generate blocks like this:\n\n\n\nHowever, with RuntimeExceptions, these intentionally bubble up and eventually get handled by the JVM or container level.  This is a good thing - it forces errors to show up and then you must fix the code directly instead of ignoring the exception - you may still end up just printing the stack trace (hopefully logging it instead of printing to the console directly), but then there will be an exception handler that you were forced to write because of a real problem - not because a method said that it might possibly throw an Exception, but that it did.\n\nSpring uses a DataAccessException to wrap SQLExceptions so that you don&#39;t have to handle them as a checked exception.  It makes code much cleaner as a result - if you expect a DataAccessException, you can handle it - but most of the time you let it propagate and be logged as an error, because your SQL should be debugged by the time you release your application, meaning the DataAccessException is probably a hardware issue that you could not resolve - DataAccessException is a much more meaningful name than SQLException, because it shows that access to data failed - not that your SQL query was nessecarily at fault.\n",

        "body": "I think I read the same Bruce Eckel interview that you did - and it&#39;s always bugged me. In fact, the argument was made by the interviewee (if this is indeed the post you&#39;re talking about) Anders Hejlsberg, the MS genius behind .Net and C#.\n\nhttp://www.artima.com/intv/handcuffs.html\n\nFan though I am of Hejlsberg and his work, this argument has always struck me as bogus. It basically boils down to: \n\n&quot;Checked exceptions are bad because programmers just abuse them by always catching them and dismissing them which leads to problems being hidden and ignored that would otherwise be presented to the user&quot;. \n\nBy &quot;otherwise presented to the user&quot; I mean if you use a runtime exception the lazy programmer will just ignore it (versus catching it with an empty catch block) and the user will see it.\n\nThe summary of the summary of the argument is that &quot;Programmers wont use them properly and not using them properly is worse than not having them&quot;.\n\nThere is some truth to this argument and in fact I suspect Goslings motivation for not putting operator overrides in Java comes from a similar argument - they confuse the programmer because they are often abused.\n\nBut in the end I find it a bogus argument of Hejlsbergs and possibly a post-hoc one created to explain the lack rather than a well thought out decision.\n\nI would argue that while the over-use of checked exceptions is a bad thing and tends to lead to sloppy handling by users, but the proper use of them allows the API programmer to give great benefit to the API client programmer.\n\nNow the API programmer has to be careful not to throw checked exceptions all over the place, or they will simply annoy the client programmer. The very lazy client programmer will resort to catch (Exception) {} as Hejlsberg warns and all benefit will be lost and hell will ensue.\nBut in some circumstances there&#39;s just no substitute for a good checked exception. \n\nFor me the classic example is the file-open API. Every programming language in the history of languages (on file systems at least) has an API somewhere that lets you open a file. And every client programmer using this API knows that they have to deal with the case that the file they are trying to open doesn&#39;t exist. \nLet me rephrase that: Every client programmer using this API should know that they have to deal with this case. \nAnd there&#39;s the rub: can the API progammer help them know they should deal with it through commenting alone or can they indeed insist the client deal with it.\n\nIn C the idiom goes something like\n\n\n\nwhere fopen indicates failure by returning 0 and C (foolishly) lets you treat 0 as a boolean and... Basically you learn this idiom and you&#39;re okay. But what if you&#39;re a noob and you didn&#39;t learn the idiom. Then of course you start out with\n\n\n\nand learn the hard way.\n\nNote that we&#39;re only talking about strongly typed languages here: There&#39;s a clear idea of what an API is in a strongly typed language: It&#39;s a smorgasbord of functionality (methods) for you to use with a clearly defined protocol for each one.\n\nThat clearly defined protocol is typically defined by a method signature. \nHere fopen requires that you pass it a string (or a char* in the case of C). If you give it something else you get a compile-time error. You didn&#39;t follow the protocol - you&#39;re not using the API properly.\n\nIn some (obscure) languages the return type is part of the protocol too. If you try to call the equivalent of fopen() in some languages without assigning it to a variable you&#39;ll also get a compile time error (you can only do that with void functions).\n\nThe point I&#39;m trying to make is that: In a statically typed language the API programmer encourages the client to use the API properly by preventing their client code from compiling if it makes any obvious mistakes.\n\n(In a dynamically typed language, like Ruby, you can pass anything, say a float, as the file name - and it will compile. Why hassle the user with checked exceptions if you&#39;re not even going to control the method arguments. The arguments made here apply to statically-typed langauges only)\n\nSo, what about checked exceptions?\n\nWell here&#39;s one of the Java APIs you can use for opening a file.\n\n\n\nSee that catch? Here&#39;s the signature for that API method:\n\n\n\nNote that FileNotFoundException is a checked exception.\n\nThe API programmer is saying this to you:\n  &quot;You may use this constructor to create a new FileInputStream but you \n\na) must pass in the file name as a\n    String\nb) must accept the\n    possibility that the file might not\n    be found at runtime&quot;\n\nAnd that&#39;s the whole point as far as I&#39;m concerned.\n\nThe key is basically what the question states as &quot;Things that are out of the programmers control&quot; My first thought was that he/she means things that are out of the API programmers control. But in fact, checked exceptions when used properly should really be for things that are out of both the client programmer&#39;s and the API programmer&#39;s control. I think this is the key to not abusing checked exceptions.\n\nI think the file-open illustrates the point nicely. The API programmer knows you might give them a file name that turns out to be nonexistent at the time the API is called, and that they won&#39;t be able to return you what you wanted, but will have to throw an exception. They also know that this will happen pretty regularly and that the client programmer might expect the file name to be correct at the time they wrote the call, but it might be wrong at runtime for reasons beyond their control too.\n\nSo the API makes it explicit: There will be cases where this file doesn&#39;t exist at the time you call me and you had damn well better deal with it.\n\nThis would be clearer with a counter-case. Imagine I&#39;m writing a table API. I have  table model somewhere with an API with this method:\n\n\n\nNow as an API programmer I know there will be cases where some client passes in a negative value for the row or a row value outside of the table. So I might be tempted to throw a checked exception and force the client to deal with it:\n\n\n\n(I wouldn&#39;t really call it &quot;Checked&quot; of course).\n\nThis is bad use of checked exceptions. The client code is going to be full of calls to fetch row data, every one of which is going to have to use a try/catch, and for what? Are they going to report to the user that the wrong row was sought? Probably not - because whatever the UI surrounding my table view is, it shouldn&#39;t let the user get into a state where an illegal row is being requested. So it&#39;s a bug on the part of the client programmer. \n\nThe API programmer can still predict that the client will code such bugs and should handle it with a runtime exception like an IllegalArgumentException. \n\nWith a checked exception in getRowData, this is clearly a case that&#39;s going to lead to Hejlsbergs lazy programmer simply adding empty catches. When that happens, the illegal row values will not be obvious even to the tester or the client developer debugging, rather they&#39;ll lead to knock-on errors that are hard to pinpoint the source of. Arianne rockets will blow up after launch. \n\nOkay, so here&#39;s the problem: I&#39;m saying that the checked exception FileNotFoundException is not just a good thing but an essential tool in the API programmers toolbox for defining the API in the most useful way for the client programmer. But the CheckedInvalidRowNumberException is a big inconvenience, leading to bad programming and should be avoided. But how to tell the difference. \n\nI guess it&#39;s not an exact science and I guess that underlies and perhaps justifies to a certain extent Hejlsbergs argument. But I&#39;m not happy throwing the baby out with the bathwater here, so allow me to extract some rules here to distinguish good checked exceptions from bad:\n\n\nOut of clients control or Closed vs Open: \n\nChecked exceptions should only be used where the error case is out of control of both the API and the client programmer.\nThis has to do with how open or closed the system is. In a constrained UI where the client programmer has control, say, over all of the buttons, keyboard commands etc that add and delete rows from the table view, (a closed system) it is a client programming bug if it attempts to fetch data from a nonexistent row. In a file based operating system where any number of users/applications can add and delete files (an open system) it is conceivable that the file the client is requesting has been deleted without their knowledge so they should be expected to deal with it.  \nUbiquity:\n\nChecked exceptions should not be used on an API call that is made frequently by the client.\nBy frequently I mean from a lot of places in the client code - not frequently in time. So a client code doesn&#39;t tend to try to open the same file a lot, but my table view gets RowData all over the place from different methods. In particular I&#39;m going to be writing a lot of code like\n\nif (model.getRowData().getCell(0).isEmpty())\n\nand it will be painful to have to wrap in try/catch every time.\nInforming the User:\n\nChecked exceptions should be used in cases where you can imagine a useful error message being presented to the end user. \nThis is the &quot;and what will you when it happens?&quot; question I raise above. It also relates to item 1. Since you can predict that something outside of your client-API system might cause the file to not be there, you can reasonably tell the user about it:\n\n&quot;Error: could not find the file &#39;goodluckfindingthisfile&#39;&quot;\n\nSince your illegal row number was caused by an internal bug and through no fault of the user, there&#39;s really no useful information you can give them. If your app doesn&#39;t let runtime exceptions fall through to the console it will probably end up giving them some ugly message like:\n\n&quot;Internal error occured: IllegalArgumentException in ....&quot;\n\nIn short, if you don&#39;t think your client programmer can explain your exception in a way that helps the user, then you should probably not be using a checked exception.\n\n\nSo those are my rules. Somewhat contrived, and there will doubtless be exceptions (please help me refine them if you will). But my main argument is that there are cases like FileNotFoundException where the checked exception is as important and useful a part of the API contract as the parameter types. So we should not dispense with it just because it is misused. \n\nSorry, didn&#39;t mean to make this so long and waffly. Let me finish with two suggestions:\n\nA: API programmers: use checked exceptions sparingly to preserve their usefulness. When in doubt use an unchecked exception.\n\nB: Client programmers: get in the habit of creating a wrapped exception (google it) early on in your development. Jdk 1.4 and later provide a constructor in RuntimeException for this, but you can easily create your own too. Here&#39;s the constuctor:\n\n\n\nThen get in the habit of whenever you have to handle a checked exception and you&#39;re feeling lazy (or you think the API programmer was overzealous in using the checked exception in the first place), don&#39;t just swallow the exception, wrap it and rethrow it.\n\n\n\nPut this in one of your IDE&#39;s little code templates and use it when you&#39;re feeling lazy. This way if you really need to handle the checked exception you&#39;ll be forced to come back and deal with it after seeing the problem at runtime. Because, believe me (and Anders Hejlsberg) you&#39;re never going to come back to that TODO in your\n\n\n",

Declare these exceptions in your interface, as the programmer will have to handle them directly.\n\nFor example, a bank account withdraw method may declare an OverdraftException, which is an expected exception - a withdrawal may fail due to overdraft, but this type of failure may be handled differently by the client code (one may decide to completely deny the withdrawal, another may decide to apply a huge penalty and allow for a negative balance to be recorded, another may decide that their client is allowed to draw from a different account).\n\nHowever, runtime exceptions were supposed to be programming errors that weren&#39;t supposed to be handled directly - such as NullPointerExceptions, which only occur if methods take invalid arguments or don&#39;t check for such cases directly.\n\nThis is a good theory.  However, Java messed up with its implementation of Exceptions, and this threw the book of this theory out the window.\n\nThere are two cases that I will illustrate where Java messed up with its implementation of Exceptions.  These are IOException and SQLException.\n\nAn IOException occurs anytime, anywhere a stream in the IO libraries of Java messes up.  This is a checked exception, however.  But, generally you cannot do anything but log that an error occur - if you&#39;re simply writing to the console, what can you reasonably be expected to do if you suddenly get an IOException when you&#39;re writing to it?\n\nBut there&#39;s more.\n\nIOException also hides stuff like file exceptions and network exceptions.  They may be subclasses of IOException floating around for that, but it is still a checked exception.  If your writing to an external file fails, you can&#39;t really do much about it - if your network connection is severed, ditto.\n\nSQLException is the same way.  Exception names should show what happened when they are called.  SQLException does not.  SQLException is thrown any single time any possible number of errors are encountered when dealing with a database - MOST OF WHICH THAT HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH SQL.\n\nTherefore, programmers typically get annoyed with handling exceptions, and let Eclipse (or whatever IDE they&#39;re using) generate blocks like this:\n\n\n\nHowever, with RuntimeExceptions, these intentionally bubble up and eventually get handled by the JVM or container level.  This is a good thing - it forces errors to show up and then you must fix the code directly instead of ignoring the exception - you may still end up just printing the stack trace (hopefully logging it instead of printing to the console directly), but then there will be an exception handler that you were forced to write because of a real problem - not because a method said that it might possibly throw an Exception, but that it did.\n\nSpring uses a DataAccessException to wrap SQLExceptions so that you don&#39;t have to handle them as a checked exception.  It makes code much cleaner as a result - if you expect a DataAccessException, you can handle it - but most of the time you let it propagate and be logged as an error, because your SQL should be debugged by the time you release your application, meaning the DataAccessException is probably a hardware issue that you could not resolve - DataAccessException is a much more meaningful name than SQLException, because it shows that access to data failed - not that your SQL query was nessecarily at fault.\n",

        "body": "I will try to give you a very precise answer, because I expect that you already have idea about checked vs non-checked exceptions. \nSO now come to your question,the answer is very simple that the RuntimeException is also an exception, so its logically as well as design wise correct. As we know that Java is OOPs principles bases language, so here it is  basically Inheritance. Runtime exception is having all the capabilities which are there in Exception class apart from that it has overridden the exception handling behaviour from its parent and that is its unchecked behaviour. The checked exception and unchecked exceptions are just differ in the way of their handing, but rest properties of being Exception in Java is same for both. So I will say is simple OOPs design(Inheritance principle) and the relationship between the two  is logically correct.\n\nThe same thing you can observe with  and  classes, now if we talk about meaning of these two in Java then exception is something which you can recover or handle but error is something which you can not recover, the only way to recover from any error is to restart the application. But then again you will see that both are extending the  class, because both are having the same property that is both can be thrown, but their handling is different, one can be handled while other can not, thats why we have one  and other is .\n\n\n\nSO for your questioin, I will say that its OOPs design, RuntimeException is inheriting from Exception class which is logically correct, Even If I were the developer of exceptions in Java, then I should have also designed these classes in the same way which are already been.  \n\nHope It may be answer to your question.\n",

Method overriding allows you to write flexible and extensible\n  code in Java because you can introduce new functionality with minimal\n  code change.\n\n\nThere are few rules which needs to be followed while overriding any method in Java, failure to follow these rules result in compile time error in Java.\n\n\nFirst and most important rule regarding method overriding in Java is that you can only override method in sub class. You can not override method in same class.\nSecond important rule of method overriding in Java that name and signature of method must be same in Super class and Sub class or in interface and its implementation.\nThird rule to override method in Java is that overriding method can not reduce accessibility of overridden method in Java. For example if overridden method is public than overriding method can not be protected, private or package-private; But opposite is true overriding method can increase accessibility of method in Java, i.e. if overridden method is protected than overriding method can be protected or public.\nAnother worth noting rule of method overriding in Java is that overriding  method can not throw checked Exception which is higher in hierarchy than overridden method. Which means if overridden method throws IOException than overriding method can not throw java.lang.Exception in its throws clause because java.lang.Exception comes higher than IOException in Exception hierarchy. This rule doesn&#39;t apply to RuntimeException in Java, which is not even need to be declared in throws clause in Java.\nYou can not override private, static and final method in Java. private and static method are bonded during compile time using static binding in Java  and doesn&#39;t resolve during runtime. overriding final method in Java is compile time error. Though private and static method can be hidden if you declare another method with same and signature in sub class.\nOverridden method is called using dynamic binding in Java at runtime based upon type of Object.\nIf you are extending abstract class or implementing interface than you need to override all abstract method unless your class is not abstract. abstract method can only be used by using method overriding.\nAlways use @Override annotation while overriding method in Java. Though this is not rule but its one of the best Java coding practice to follow. From Java 6 you can use @Override annotation on method inherited from interface as well.\n\n",

Your code delegates part of request processing to newly created threads, which are not from the request processing thread pool, so the limit of that pool is not hit any sooner. In fact, because the request processing takes less time, the request processing threads are returned to the pool faster, increasing the number of requests per second the request processing thread pool can handle.\n\nIs there some other limit for the number of threads? As Java uses operating system threads, this is typically up to the operating system, and you may find How many threads can a Java VM support? interesting reading. However, a couple thousand threads are certainly possible, as the following test program (which I have adapted from the linked question) demonstrates:\n\n\n\nOn my Windows 8.1 workstation, its output ends with:\n\n\n\ni.e. we get a JVM crash - at about 150000 threads. 6000 threads are probably fine on all platforms.\n\nHowever, you don&#39;t invoke  after you are done with the executor, causing the threads to continue to wait for more tasks - presumably until the executor is garbage collected. This is a needless waste of memory. Moreover, on old JVMs were thread stacks are in a separate memory space, you may run out of thread stack space before the garbage collector runs on the heap and collects the executor object. This may be what your colleagues were referring to. \n\nI find it questionable that you do not reuse threads - after all, creating a thread involves some overhead (such as allocating space for its stack). Also, a shared thread pool would allow you to limit the number of concurrent cache accesses (if talking to the cache involves network I/O, 6000 open tcp sockets may exhaust file handles, or simply overload the other system).

        "body": "Today, I answered an ordinary question of some Java beginner. A little bit later I thought it would be fun to take his question seriously and so I implemented exactly what he wants.\n\nI created a simple code for runtime Class generation. Most of the code is taken from a template, the only possible change is to declare some fields. Generated code could be written as:\n\n\n\nThe generated Class file is then loaded into the JVM using a custom ClassLoader.\n\nThen I implemented something like &quot;static hashtable&quot;. Programmer enters all the possible keys and then it generates a Class (where each key is as a field). In the moment we have instance of this class, we may also save or read those generated fields using reflection.\n\nHere is a whole code:\n\n\n\nIt works, but it is terribly slow. I expected it would be a little bit faster as data are stored in fields, which are manipulated by JVM (using a native code). The most serious explanation which I can think of is that reflection is extremely slow.\n\nTo make it perfectly clear, I was not going to use it anyway. Event if it actually was faster that code is so terrible and unmaintainable it would not be worth of it. A functionality is also very limited (key must be a valid field name etc). It just looked like a cool experiment.\n\nAnyway, does anybody have an idea why is it about 100 times slower than &quot;ordinary&quot; hash table? I guess it is caused by a reflection, but I would appreciate other people&#39;s opinions.\n\nUpdate: It is really caused by reflection as Antimony and NSF pointed out. I tried to set up some static field in the &quot;normal&quot; way and using reflection. According to this test, reflection is about 280 times slower. But I have no idea why.\n",

It does, however, present a theoretical (but flawed) basis that might help in understanding Michał Marczyk&#39;s answer.  If you are having trouble understanding that answer, this answer might help by breaking things down a little more.  It also illustrates several pitfalls you might encounter.  But otherwise, just ignore this answer.\n\n implements , so theoretically this should be as easy as iterating over successive tail sequences until  returns false:\n\n\n\nNow, if you truly have a 100%  from start to finish, that&#39;s it --  will return the items of  that have been realized.\n\nEdit: Ok, not really.  This will work for determining which items were realized before an exception was thrown.  However, as Michal Marcyzk points out, it will cause every item in the sequence to be realized in other contexts.\n\nYou can then write your cleanup logic like this:\n\n\n\nHowever, be aware that a lot of Clojure&#39;s &quot;lazy&quot; constructs are not 100% lazy.  For example,  will return a , but if you start ing down it, it turns into a .  Unfortunately,  does not implement , and calling  on one will throw an exception.  To work around this, we can use  to explicitly build a  that will stay a  for any sequence:\n\n\n\nEdit:  As Michał Marczyk pointed out in a comment,  does not guarantee the underlying sequence is lazily consumed.  In fact, it will probably realize previously unrealized items (but appears to only throw an exception the first time through).  Its sole purpose is to guarantee that calling  results in either  or a .  In other words, it works well enough to run the example below, but YMMV.\n\nNow if we use the same &quot;lazified&quot; sequence in both the  and the cleanup code, we will be able to use .
